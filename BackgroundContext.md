Darren and Anshul are giving a talk on the role of AI, AGI and robotics in systems transformation. 

the theme of the conference is AI, AGI, and global transformation.

Darren is co-founder of Gaia AI https://gaiaai.xyz/, and Kwaxala https://www.kwaxala.com/, and working with Regenerate Cascadia https://regeneratecascadia.org/, and Open Civics https://www.opencivics.co/, and a Mapmakers Tech Guild (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LorNbgy91L23YsdRKA3VpAWavKC87mzsIPemcJULeo0/edit?usp=sharing) and Antoehr World is Possible (https://anotherworld.earth/) and Glocha (https://www.glocha.org/)


Anshul bio:
As CEO of NuPeak Robotics (https://nupeak.com/), I blend engineering rigor with a vision for post-scarcity through robotics and automation. My background in Engineering Physics and medical device startups taught me to transform manual labor into elegant systems. This led me to develop robots that learn from experience, mimicking a child's discovery process—an approach that's attracted $3M from Cornell University and UBC. I hold several patents in machine vision and robotics, but my real interest lies in the philosophical implications: How will automation reshape society? What does it mean when machines learn like humans? As someone who talks nerdy about robotics, I'm equally fascinated by the ways we'll need to navigate this transformation. I spend considerable time contemplating how work, identity, and human purpose will evolve—and I'd love to exchange ideas with fellow thinkers at Protocols.


the person hosting the event (investor Wenxing Chen) is dedicated to projects that serve humanity, especially AI ethics/education reform.

and I am speaking after my other friend Mehul who is giving a talk "Language, meaning and the deep structure of reality." with description: The AI revolution is exposing a truth our sciences and philosophies have long circled but never fully claimed: meaning is not a byproduct of reality, but its organizing principle. This talk explores meaning as the missing layer in our understanding of mind, matter, society and machine: How reality, from cells to civilizations to emerging AI systems, is shaped by deep semantic structures.
