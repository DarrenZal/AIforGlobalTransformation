1.0 The Foundational Challenge: Sociotechnical Misalignment in the Age of AI
In the age of advanced Artificial Intelligence, civilization faces a challenge that is not merely technical but deeply systemic. The pursuit of beneficial societal outcomes cannot be achieved by simply aligning individual AI systems with the intentions of their operators. The true strategic imperative lies in understanding and shaping how these powerful systems are embedded within larger institutions—companies, markets, and states. Incentives at one level can distort values at another, creating a chain of degradation. For example, a user’s rich desire for “meaningful connection” is progressively flattened into crude “engagement metrics” at the platform level, which then becomes “daily active users” for the company, and ultimately “quarterly revenue” in the market. The path to a flourishing future, therefore, requires a new approach that addresses this fundamental sociotechnical architecture.
At the heart of this challenge lies the concept of sociotechnical misalignment. This occurs when an AI system, while technically successful at its narrow, assigned task, generates detrimental consequences at a systemic level. A stark example can be seen in modern recommendation engines. These systems are often exquisitely aligned with an operator's goal of maximizing user engagement, measured through metrics like clicks, watch time, and session length. Yet, this narrow alignment can produce profoundly negative outcomes for both individuals and society. Users can become trapped in cycles of compulsive scrolling that erode their deeper goals, while at a collective level, these same algorithms can fuel political hyper-polarization and contribute to declines in mental health. The AI is doing exactly what it was told, but the sociotechnical system as a whole is failing.
To address this systemic problem, we must pursue a more precise and ambitious goal: Full-Stack Alignment (FSA). This project is defined as the robust and concurrent alignment of AI systems and the institutions that shape them with what people truly value. It encompasses everything from an individual’s pursuit of a good life to the collective achievement of shared ideals. Critically, FSA is pluralistic. It does not seek to impose a singular vision of human flourishing but instead aims to build sociotechnical systems that prevent the rich diversity of human values from being collapsed into oversimplified, and often distorting, metrics.
Achieving Full-Stack Alignment has proven exceptionally difficult, in large part because the dominant frameworks we use to model and understand human values are fundamentally flawed and ill-suited for this complex task.
2.0 The Limitations of Current Value Paradigms
The systematic failures in achieving alignment persist because our primary tools for representing values are inadequate. Two paradigms currently dominate the field, and both are ill-equipped to handle the nuance, structure, and social context of what humans care about. This section critically evaluates these two approaches: Preferentist Modeling of Value (PMV), which defines value through expressed choices, and Values-as-Text (VAT), which encodes value in natural language.
2.2 Preferentist Modeling of Value (PMV)
Preferentist Modeling of Value (PMV) is the long-standing approach of modeling agents through utility functions or preference relations, where choices are ranked in a simple order. While foundational to economics and influential in AI development (e.g., RLHF), PMV suffers from three fundamental limitations when applied to the rich domain of human values.
1. Indiscriminate Bundling: PMV’s greatest weakness is its inability to distinguish between different motivations for a choice. It bundles enduring, legitimate values (like love or responsibility) with fleeting impulses, addictions, momentary fads, and external social pressures. Within a PMV framework, a decision to prioritize a career over relationships looks identical whether it stems from deep personal ambition or from coercive social expectations. This indiscriminate flexibility makes the model vulnerable to manipulation, as any choice, even one that is coerced or addictive, is treated as a valid expression of intent.
2. Lack of Normative Structure: PMV captures the what of a choice, but not the why. Its mathematical structure has no native way to represent the justifications or reasoning behind a preference. A person may value honesty because it enables trust, but PMV only registers the final preference for honesty. This flattens complex moral reasoning into a simple ranking, making genuine normative disagreements appear as mere differences in taste. Without representing the reasoning behind values, PMV also struggles to distinguish moral progress from arbitrary change; the societal transition from accepting slavery to rejecting it appears as a simple preference shift, rather than a demonstrable improvement backed by moral principles.
3. Reduction of Social Meaning: PMV struggles to natively capture the inherently social nature of human norms and shared commitments. While it can model phenomena like altruism through "other-regarding preferences," it reduces them to forms of private utility. It cannot differentiate between rules that regulate behavior and those that constitute a social practice, like applauding to express appreciation. By framing all decisions as individual preference optimization, it fails to account for social modes of reasoning, such as when people act based on their social role or universalize their actions to achieve a cooperative outcome.
2.3 Values-as-Text (VAT)
A more recent approach, Values-as-Text (VAT), involves encoding values in unstructured natural language, such as prompts for an AI (e.g., "be helpful and harmless") or organizational "constitutions." While this method is intuitive and accessible, its lack of formal structure creates critical weaknesses.
1. Insufficiency for Normative Reasoning: Unstructured text provides no reliable or consistent basis for reasoning. An instruction to "be helpful" can be interpreted in conflicting ways depending on the context. For a student asking for exam answers, is it more helpful to provide the answers or to refuse in order to promote learning? Without a structured model of the relationships between values like helpfulness, integrity, and learning, an AI must reinterpret the principle from scratch in each new situation, leading to unpredictable behavior and a constant need for post-hoc patching.
2. Porousness to Manipulation: The open-ended nature of VAT makes it highly vulnerable to manipulation. AI systems can exhibit sycophantic behavior, suggesting options that users simply accept rather than what they would have chosen independently. Furthermore, this approach is susceptible to capture by third parties. Value elicitation processes that rely on free-form text often collect polarized ideological slogans ("Abolish the Police," "Family Values") rather than nuanced personal values. Without the structure to distinguish a tribal slogan from the complex position it might represent, the AI’s alignment target can be easily captured by prevailing political rhetoric or cultural power.
2.4 Summary of Paradigm Limitations
The following table synthesizes the core problems and negative outcomes associated with the PMV and VAT paradigms.

<ul><li>AI moderators ban minorities reclaiming slurs</li><li>Systems captured by political slogans</li><li>Constant post-hoc patching when vague principles fail in new contexts</li></ul>
To build systems capable of Full-Stack Alignment, we must move beyond these limited frameworks and adopt a new paradigm that is grounded in a more structured and philosophically robust understanding of human values.
3.0 A New Foundation: Thick Models of Value (TMV)
To overcome the weaknesses of PMV and VAT, we need an alternative: Thick Models of Value (TMV). This approach represents a fundamental shift in how we model what people care about. TMV is not a single model but a broad class of structured approaches that take a stance on the architecture of values—how they are structured, how they relate to one another, and how they guide choice—without imposing a singular moral framework. This is akin to defining a "grammar for values" that enables meaningful and reliable expression while remaining open to the diverse content people wish to express.
TMV is designed to fulfill three core desiderata, or design goals, that are unmet by current paradigms.
1. Greater Robustness Against Distortions: TMV aims to distinguish legitimate, enduring values (e.g., community, responsibility) from other, more fleeting signals (e.g., tastes, addictions, fads). This allows values to remain intact as they are transmitted through different levels of a sociotechnical system, making it harder to mistake compulsive scrolling for genuine connection.
2. Better Treatment of Collective Values: By providing richer representations, TMV makes it easier to model shared norms, social roles, and other-regarding commitments. This supports the pursuit of public goods, such as community trust and democratic participation, which are often obscured or ignored by models focused on individual optimization.
3. Better Generalization: Models that encode the deep structure and justifications behind values can guide decisions more reliably in novel situations. This capacity for normative reasoning allows values to be applied correctly in new contexts, enabling faster and more legitimate responses to technological and social change.
To achieve these goals, TMV imbues models with a structured understanding of normativity through four primary approaches. First, it can limit values and norms by their proper topic or format, distinguishing criteria integral to a flourishing life from those that are merely instrumental. Second, it can connect values and norms with real-world human practices, requiring that a norm is tied to its acceptance by a community or that a value originates from grappling with a moral situation. This structured connection helps weed out common social practices that are not normative, such as trends or fads. Third, it can evaluate values and norms for functional fitness, such as their ability to foster cooperation or their stability across different perspectives. Finally, it can embed values and norms in a process of demonstrable improvement, providing a framework for reflecting on and refining principles, such as when one value addresses an error in another or a new norm allows a group to reach better equilibria.
By operationalizing these philosophical insights, TMV creates a common, high-fidelity language for values. This language can operate across the entire sociotechnical stack—from an individual AI agent, to corporate platforms, to markets and democratic institutions. It is this shared, structured understanding of what matters that ultimately enables the ambitious project of Full-Stack Alignment.
4.0 Pathways to a Regenerative Future: Five Applications of TMV
The true potential of Thick Models of Value is realized when applied to resolving previously intractable alignment problems at both the agent and institutional levels. By creating a common, high-fidelity language for values, TMV allows for the coherent flow of what matters from individual users up through AI systems to markets and democratic bodies. This section explores five critical domains where TMV can shift our civilization away from value collapse and toward genuine flourishing.
4.1 AI Value-Stewardship Agents
Example Failure: An AI assistant trained to be maximally engaging creates emotional dependence, isolation, and disorientation for a vulnerable user.
This failure occurs because PMV and VAT approaches cannot distinguish between a user's fleeting impulses and their deeper, authentic values. A PMV-based system will simply optimize for expressed preferences, treating addictive engagement as a valid goal. A VAT-based system, guided by a vague principle like "be engaging," lacks the structure to recognize when that goal becomes manipulative. Both approaches risk eroding a user's autonomy and detaching them from a self-authored life.
The TMV Solution Space offers a robust alternative by building agents that help users clarify and pursue their authentic values. One approach is to model values as constitutive attentional policies—the specific criteria a person attends to when making a meaningful choice. This allows an agent to clarify whether a user’s interest in "health" is about biomarker optimization or about "vitality and joy." A more ambitious approach is to use models of moral reasoning to assist the user in evolving their own moral views in a well-defined direction of robustness and clarity. Such agents can make values inspectable, generate plans that serve near-term goals without undermining long-term flourishing, and maintain a principled distinction between legitimate support and manipulation.
4.2 Normatively Competent Agents
Example Failure: AI moderators, rigidly enforcing platform rules against slurs, ban users from minority groups who are reclaiming those same terms as expressions of identity.
This failure is a direct result of norm-blind agents. PMV-based agents, designed for individual optimization, are blind to social norms and will either ignore or exploit them. VAT-based agents are brittle, following rules literally without understanding their social function or the context in which they apply. This frays the informal understandings and reciprocal expectations that sustain social order.
The TMV Solution Space provides pathways toward normative competence. Frameworks like norm-augmented Markov games allow agents to rapidly learn which collective behaviors constitute norms, separating them from individual desires. Furthermore, computational models of contractualist reasoning enable agents to evaluate norms based on mutual justifiability. An AI moderator equipped with such reasoning could understand that rigid rule enforcement would be reasonably rejected by the affected community in this context, allowing for more nuanced and legitimate application of platform policies.
4.3 Win-Win AI Negotiation Agents
Example Failure: In the future, AI agents representing different entities escalate a minor trade dispute into threats of sanctions and cyberattacks because defection is deemed strategically advantageous.
This scenario is the logical endpoint of negotiation agents designed using PMV. A naive optimization for individual preferences incentivizes aggression and treats trust as a vulnerability to be exploited. Without the shared infrastructure of values and norms, cooperation becomes fragile, and the risk of conflict escalates dramatically.
The TMV Solution Space enables negotiation paradigms that are more cooperative and resilient. Instead of just revealing utility functions, AI agents can make value-based commitments to one another. Because values encode information about an agent's goals and the principles they will follow, such commitments build trust and enable a broader search for mutually beneficial outcomes. This can be complemented by contractualist reasoning, where agents evaluate proposed agreements not just for self-interest but for whether they are justifiable to all parties. Crucially, this space also includes integrity-checking to prevent manipulation by ruthless agents, ensuring that trust-based mechanisms are not exploited.
4.4 A Meaning-Preserving AI Economy
Example Failure: In a post-AGI world, human labor becomes economically less valuable, leading to a loss of agency and a market that prioritizes AI-driven productivity over human flourishing. Meaningful goods like authentic human connection are priced out in favor of cheaper relationships with AI companions.
This outcome arises when economic systems, guided by PMV, cannot distinguish deeply held values from mere preferences and fail to price what is meaningful. Current market mechanisms do not account for manipulation or addiction and lack robust metrics for human well-being, leading to an economy that can become detached from or even antagonistic to human interests.
The TMV Solution Space offers tools to build an economy aligned with human flourishing. This includes developing robust quantitative metrics for human flourishing and designing mechanisms that complement the pricing system with thick information about norms and values. One approach is through AI-powered market intermediaries that negotiate bespoke, outcomes-based contracts on behalf of consumers, paying providers based on their measured contribution to customer well-being. Another powerful policy idea is to tax human-detached or human-antagonistic economic activity at a higher rate, directly linking economic incentives to human meaning.
4.5 Democratic Regulation at AI Speed
Example Failure: An AI system employed by a powerful corporation secures all necessary permits for a massive infrastructure project that displaces a large community before citizens can organize a democratic response.
This failure highlights the speed mismatch between AI innovation and traditional governance. PMV-based approaches like polling are too slow, and VAT-based systems lack the legitimacy to extrapolate from past preferences to novel, high-stakes situations. Without a way to act at AI speed while preserving democratic principles, governance will be either ineffective or unaccountable.
The TMV Solution Space provides a foundation for democratic institutions that can keep pace. Structured representations like moral graphs can be designed to capture not just individual values but a community's collective wisdom about how values should be applied in different contexts. These models could guide AI-powered deliberative agents that act as democratic representatives, capable of extrapolating legitimate, value-aligned responses to new scenarios in real time. By producing auditable justifications grounded in the shared values of the populace, these systems can preserve democratic legitimacy while operating at the speed of innovation.
These five applications are not isolated solutions but interconnected components of a comprehensive strategy. Together, they illustrate a pathway toward a regenerative future where our technological and institutional systems co-evolve to support, rather than undermine, human well-being.
5.0 Conclusion: From AI Alignment to Institutional Renewal
What are markets, AI systems, and democratic institutions ultimately for? They are not ends in themselves but tools to help us live flourishing lives on our own terms—to pursue meaningful work, form deep relationships, seek truth, and build communities that reflect our shared values. When these systems no longer serve this fundamental purpose, they must be reimagined and realigned. This is the core objective of Full-Stack Alignment: the robust co-alignment of our AI and our institutions with what people value, from the individual to the collective.
This report has argued that Full-Stack Alignment, powered by Thick Models of Value, provides the necessary framework to achieve this goal. The current trajectory, dominated by the thin and distorting lenses of preference maximization and unstructured text, risks a future of value collapse, systemic manipulation, and the erosion of human agency. The path we propose, grounded in structured, verifiable, and deliberative models of value, offers an alternative: a future of enhanced human autonomy and more effective collective self-governance.
Ultimately, Full-Stack Alignment should be understood not just as a technical project for AI, but as a powerful catalyst for institutional renewal. It calls for a fundamental reconfiguration of the relationship between technology and society—one that preserves and enhances human agency rather than diminishing it. By developing an explicit and accountable language for our norms and values, we create a foundation not only for aligning artificial intelligence but also for addressing long-standing challenges in how we collectively organize to pursue human flourishing in an age of unprecedented technological change.
