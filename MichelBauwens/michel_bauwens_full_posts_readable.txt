“Nullius in verba” - Take no one’s word for it.

Yes, the motto of the Royal Society of London.

Officially founded on November 28, 1660, after a lecture by Christopher Wren at Gresham College. The society was a loose network of Natural philosophers (later called Scientists) who had been meeting since the 1640s. Their goal was to improve natural knowledge by observation and experimentation. Robert Hooke was the society’s first Curator of Experiments, responsible for coordinating experiments at the society’s meetings. This is widely recognized as the first public demonstration of science.

But a revolution began when Henry Oldenburg, the society’s first Secretary, began to catalogue the society’s discoveries and disseminated them across Europe. Called “Philosophical Transactions”, the world’s first and longest-running scientific journal. It wasn’t “peer reviewing” or “publication” as in the modern sense (although it did set the stage for it). At the time, it did only one fundamental thing: it made knowledge public. Oldenburg published at his own expense, barely making any profit, but the idea of co-creating and co-sharing knowledge stuck.

Fast forward three centuries later. The open science movement starts to gain momentum as researchers chafe against the paywalls, publication delays and gatekeeping that have calcified academic publishing; a complete departure from the ideals of the Royal Society of London. ArXiv launches in 1991, Paul Ginsparg’s preprint server for physicists. The Budapest Open Access Initiative formalizes the movement’s principles in 2002: research should be “free and unrestricted” online, especially if publicly funded. Open access journals like PLoS ONE launch in 2006, daring to challenge the Elsevier-Springer duopoly. Sci-Hub appears in 2011, Alexandra Elkabkyan’s “pirate” library for the global research underclass, and suddenly millions of papers that cost $40 (or more) each are made available to all. The open science movement is, in many ways, a return to the Royal Society’s original ethos; before scholarly publishing became a multibillion-dollar industry built on unpaid peer review and extractive institutional paywalls.

The Origins of De(centralized) Sci(ence)

I describe DeSci as an evolution of the Open Science movement because the core ideals overlap. The only difference is in “decentralization”, i.e leveraging the Web3 stack (technologies such as decentralized finance, DeFi, and frameworks such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, DAOs).

In 2004, David Koepsell, philosopher, legal scholar and later co-founder of EncrypGen, was teaching a course called “Research Integrity: Why Good Scientists do Bad Things”. The course was built around Robert Merton’s “Ethos of Science”, four principles (organized skepticism, universalism, communalism and disinterestedness) that Merton had argued were essential for science to function. By 2008, Koepsell was at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, running peer-training programs on scientific integrity and coordinating the creation of institutional review boards. Later on in 2010, he published “Back to Basics: How Technology and the Open Source Movement Can Save Science” in Social Epistemology. His argument: the internet, specifically wiki technologies, could resolve the tensions in Merton’s ethos by making science “speedier, more transparent, and democratic”. He called it “Science 3.0”. Six years later, after stints working with Mexico’s National Commission of Bioethics and publishing two books on research ethics, Koepsell gave a talk at his alma mater that sparked EncrypGen: “The Blockchain and Personal Genomics: tracking rights and responsibilities securely”.

By December 2016, the abstract had materialized. Koepsell and his wife, geneticist Dr. Vanessa Gonzalez, incorporated EncrypGen to build a blockchain-based marketplace for de-identified genomic data. The prototype debuted in May 2017 at the Bio-IT World conference in Boston; by 2018, the first public product launched: a peer-to-peer marketplace eliminating large data brokers and settling transactions in $DNA, a native cryptocurrency. The term “DeSci” itself was coined internally at EncrypGen in early 2021, riffing on “DeFi” (Decentralized Finance), which had become a crypto rallying cry. Koepsell and his team first used it publicly on February 26, 2021, during a YouTube AMA and within a year, the term had gone from internal branding to a movement identifier.

The Current Models

I should mention that the DeSci ecosystem is still quite young and these models are still a work in progress. However, after tracing the philosophical and technological origins, the guts of DeSci in the Global North reveal themselves in two working frameworks:

Model 1: The Molecule AG Path – IP Tokenization and DAO Commercialization

Molecule AG, founded by Paul Kohlhaas and Tyler Golato in 2018, is the backbone for DeSci’s most ambitious experiments with decentralized biotech. Think of it as the parent company enabling an entire family of bioDAOs; from VitaDAO (longevity and senescence research) to HairDAO (hair loss therapeutics), PsyDAO (psychedelic science), and AthenaDAO (women’s health). The structure is modular: Molecule AG coordinates the DAO ecosystem, spinning off specialized DAOs as operational companies funded and governed by community participants.​

The crucial mechanism here is IP tokenization. Scientific intellectual property (traditionally guarded by patents and venture capital) is fractionated into blockchain-based tokens (IP-NFTs), which can be crowd-owned, licensed, or sold to pharma giants, all via DAO governance. The birth of the BIO Protocol meta-DAO solves the classic focus problem: too many niches within biotech to align everyone on a single crown-jewel. Instead, small, focused DAOs like VitaDAO can pursue their particular science, raise liquidity through IP tokens, run targeted crowdsales, and offer autonomy to their communities. Capital flows in through project tokens, equity positions, and strategic partnerships. Profit is made via IP licensing, sales, or even product commercialization (as with HairDAO’s actual haircare products).​

Model 2: The ResearchHub Path – Platform-Based Collaboration and Incentives

ResearchHub, founded by Brian Armstrong (the Coinbase CEO) in 2020, takes a more centralized but radically incentive-driven approach. Rather than a protocol, it is a unified platform aiming to modernize peer review and research collaboration for all domains. Here, the central problem isn’t just technological but the broken incentives behind reputation and reward in academia.​

In ResearchHub’s system, reviewers are paid (yes, actually paid) for submitting thoughtful feedback on research papers, typically $150 in RSC tokens per high-quality review. There are bounties on posted research questions and funded studies, all rewarding constructive contribution. Content creation is incentivized by upvotes, like Reddit but remixed for scientific value. The liquidity model is direct: tokens earn value as more researchers use the platform, generating network effects, and (eventually) premium institutional features or hosting services for universities.

The difference is structural. Molecule AG’s DAOs and tokenization approach seek to decentralize everything (ownership, governance, funding) while ResearchHub unifies the conversation, sets incentives to the forefront, and lets community rewards drive collaboration. Both models see financial liquidity as crucial: whether it’s the flow of investment into DAO treasuries and IP-NFT projects, or platform tokens cycling through peer review and creation.

Contextualizing DeSci in Africa

DeSci Nigeria is Africa’s first decentralized research infrastructure, and over the last 11 months, I’ve been leading a lean but mean team to address some of the long-standing challenges we have in academia. While there is an abundance of knowledge production and relative disposable income in most parts of the West, this is not the case for Africa; a continent that accounts for about 17% of the global population but only produces less than 3% of the world’s research output. On the surface, it seems as though the continent isn’t producing knowledge. But again, this is not the case.

For instance, in Nigeria alone, over 700,000 students complete their undergraduate studies annually, each with a compulsory final year project leading to (at least) a research paper. Assuming 700k is constant across the 54 countries in Africa, that’s 378million worth of final year thesis annually! The challenge is that all of these remain siloed across the continent in drawers and shelves, poorly managed and yielding zero value.

To this end, we run the following initiatives at DeSci Nigeria:

A discipline-agnostic, open-access decentralized infrastructure for Africans to share their knowledge. Our alpha version went live in early September and as of Oct 25, 2025, we have had 40 papers uploaded across West Africa, with the highest number of studies from Nigeria across 15 tertiary institutions. Some of the current fields include; Arts & Humanities, Clinical Sciences, Computing, Communication & Information, Pure & Applied Sciences, and Social Sciences; with the highest number of studies from Social Sciences.

“If the current models described above have tokens, why avoid launching a token?”

We are not averse to launching a token but the African context demands more than a token. It demands trust, a careful dance with the socioeconomic terrain, and most importantly, proven utility. DeSci NG’s experiment is; Can we build a web of trust, improvisation and grassroots participation that can stand the test of speculative economics? We are setting the groundwork and watching the answer unfold in real time.

We invite everyone to directly support the work by donating on Giveth. Every fund is directed towards scaling the above initiatives.

Towards a Type-1 Civilization

(The first part of this article is a recap of the P2P/Commons vision and analysis; part two goes into the logic of non-territorial nation-building, and ‘what is missing’ in the Network State vision..)

Part One: A Recap of the P2P/Commons Analysis and Vision

When I started this Substack newsletter in October 2023, I decided to dedicate it to the concept of the Fourth Civilization.

The inspiration came from my decision in 2020, during the year of the outbreak of Covid, to study macro-historians in a systematic way, and in particular from the scheme of civilizational evolution outlined by Arnold Toynbee in The Study of History.

Let me give some overview of the main findings of my inquiry, as a priori context.

To recap:

The first phase of civilization consists of the agriculture-based, temple-managed, militarized civilizations in Mesopotamia, but before the great changes that would take place during the Axial Age.

So why speak about a ‘Fourth Civilization’ ?

Because, in our opinion and based on substantial research, the industrial model of civilization, as it functions today, is not compatible with the continued long-term existence of the biosphere.

Of course, this does not mean that humanity needs to live without industry, but rather that an exclusively extractive model, based on the infinite growth of capital, is not compatible with the necessary regeneration of natural resources.

As Adam Frank has put it:

“Earth evolved …

From the emergence of an immature biosphere, which is not in equilibrium

After the Great Oxygenation, a mature biosphere is created, the so-called Gaia system, identified by Lynn Margulis

This allows for the emergence of human culture, characterized by the development of an immature technosphere initially damaging the biosphere

This allows for the emergence of human culture, characterized by the development of an immature technosphere initially damaging the biosphere

Hence the need for a mature technosphere to become compatible with a balanced and long lasting biosphere.”

Hence the need for a mature technosphere to become compatible with a balanced and long lasting biosphere.”

The big debate in that context is between forces that flatly deny these natural limits, and, within the camp that recognizes these planetary limits, the debates concern the level of material wealth or material abundance that can be maintained within those limits. This division is now part of our geopolitical reality, dividing Electro States vs Petro States.

The P2P Foundation and myself, are, on the one hand,

agnostic about the precise level of scarcity/abundance that can be reached within those limits, i.e. we are not ‘per se’ degrowthers, but simply stating that the human economy must recognize those limits

agnostic about the precise level of scarcity/abundance that can be reached within those limits, i.e. we are not ‘per se’ degrowthers, but simply stating that the human economy must recognize those limits

But what we are specific on is the stated belief that mutualization is the key to maintaining the highest possible level of human welfare.

But what we are specific on is the stated belief that mutualization is the key to maintaining the highest possible level of human welfare.

Hence our proposals for a cosmo-local world order, in which substantial matter/energy relocalization is matched to global collaborative infrastructures for global mutual coordination, and substantial levels of mutualization regarding local physical resources. We have reported that broadly, the relocalization of our economy, following a principle of the ‘subsidiarity of material production’, could save two-thirds of matter/energy expenditure, and that mutualization could save up to 95%, in certain cases, of energy expenditures. John Thackara calls this, ‘Factor 20 Reduction’.

In this integrative ‘transcend and include’ model, the market and state forms of coordination do not disappear, but they are held in check by a level of meta-governance and regulation that must operate at the planetary level.

Thus, I have also written a history of global regulation which shows:

The participatory nature of indigenous regulation through the respect for the spiritual ownership of natural resources

The participatory nature of indigenous regulation through the respect for the spiritual ownership of natural resources

The respect of Empire for the commons’ institutions which maintain a balance between humanity and nature

How capitalism destroys the commons and tasks the nation-state with the regulation of the extraction-oriented market instead

How this equilibrium is destroyed when the transnationalization of global capital destroys the regulatory capacity of the nation-state.

How this equilibrium is destroyed when the transnationalization of global capital destroys the regulatory capacity of the nation-state.

It is in this context that we have also identified a Pulsation of the Commons that operates throughout human history. In the up-cycles of societies and civilizations, the market-state institutions strengthen, and the commons weaken, while in the down-cycles, the opposite occurs: to the degree that market and state institutions fail to satisfy human needs, the local populations reverted to their commons-centric practices. In Dark Ages, when market-state institutions practically disappear, the commons institutions, such as the productive monasteries of the European Dark Ages, become nearly hegemonic, and central to the recovery of the blighted lands.

During the spiral development of human civilization, which combines

a regular accumulation of knowledge, the size of cities, etc. … as well as

cyclic up and downs, and, Finally,

cyclic up and downs, and, Finally,

chaotic bifurcations that lead from one model of society to another.

Through these phase changes, the commons always exist, but take on different forms. Thus the physical commons of indigenous and traditional societies, become the social commons of industrial society, the digital commons of networked society, finally evolving to the emerging ‘phygital’ commons that will be central in the next civilizational phase.

Concerning the particular transition at hand in the present inter-civilizational moment,, I have argued that what is needed at this stage is neither a global self-regulated market, as market forces are notoriously bad at self-regulation, given their focus on capital and profit accumulation, and that the dangers of a world government may outweigh its benefits.

Hence the call for a new type of commons-centric but cosmo-local regulation.

We have also offered a geopolitical framing, heavily inspired by the conclusions of Michael Hudson’s historical trilogy on the evolution of finance from the Neolithic to today.

He contrasts,

An Eastern Eurasian model that is harmony-oriented, marked by Empire, and oriented around the central role of the state as regulator of market forces

An Eastern Eurasian model that is harmony-oriented, marked by Empire, and oriented around the central role of the state as regulator of market forces

A Western Eurasian model, based on the recognition of conflict, and with a focus on the centrality of the market

A Western Eurasian model, based on the recognition of conflict, and with a focus on the centrality of the market

However, I argue that one of the characteristics of this civilizational interstitial period is the emergence of a new realm, i.e. the development of non-territorial communities based on the new capacities that were created through digital networking. This cosmo-political non-territorial level has existed before, linked to the capacity of the transportation and communication networks, but has now reached a fundamentally higher level of ‘phygital’ development, through the technological capacity for real-time coordination of human activities at global scale.

The implication of this is that, if civilization was a territorial arrangement, based on the production of surplus by farmers to feed specialized castes in the cities; then the post-geographic nature of digitally networked communities challenges the very civilizational model itself.

Thus, the ‘Fourth Civilization’ thesis, may also be considered as a kind of Post-Civilizational model, which needs to solve three priorities:

A new compact between humanity and nature, which recognizes the mutual interdependence of the relationship and thus re-equilibrates the balance between extraction and regeneration

A new compact between humanity and nature, which recognizes the mutual interdependence of the relationship and thus re-equilibrates the balance between extraction and regeneration

A new global compact regarding human solidarity so that the high level of tensions between nations and within nations can be kept between bonds. In other words, an extension of the social-democratic compact between workers (the value-creating class), and the managerial classes (the organizers of value) to the whole planet

New forms of planetary global governance that allow for the coordination of value exchange, and the finding of common solutions for trans-local, planetary-scale challenges.

Therefore, the Fourth Civilization is also the First ‘Planetary’ Civilization.

Chor Pharn, a futurist based in Singapore, calls it a ‘Type-1 Civilization’:

“Type One. Not an empire, but a planetary coordination; not a flag, but a way to hold all the energy of a world without burning the world.” [1]

He adds: < A civilisation earns the right to dispatch only when it can do so without depletion. >

We are thus in a civilizational intercycle between the industrial-cognitive form of civilization which is still not able to live in long-term balance with its biosphere, and a new type of civilization which should be.

Constructing a Geopolitical Capacity for Planetary Coordination: East vs West vs Digital

How are the different geopolitical models facing these challenges ?

China is at the leading edge for the Eastern Eurasian model and has developed an alternative for the Western model.

When Ji Ping acceded to power in 2013, he initiated a number of important adjustments:

The political priorities became both Common Prosperity and Ecological Civilization, i.e. a blend of ‘extraction’ in the service of income growth for the population as a whole, but also a conscious strategy to face the “metabolic challenges’ of a world in overshoot. Officials are now judged based on their capacity to advance these two goals ‘at the same time’. The model combines intense extractive activity to continue to build out a material industrial base, with advanced economic AND civic infrastructures for mobility and communication, and to extend it to the rest of the world. For example through the ‘Belt and Road’ initiative, which connects the whole of Eurasia into a China-led supply chain, and can be projected globally through shipping.

The paradox of the Chinese model is that it combines very high levels of extraction, i.e. matter/energy use, but at the same time, invests everything it can into its ‘metabolic’ transition, for example through massive investment into renewables, for which it has become a world leader.

Here is a quote from Chor Pharn resuming the extraordinary achievements of the Chinese model in the renewable transition:

“”An electrostate is a country whose power rests on surplus electrons and compute. Instead of living off scarcity rents — coal seams, oil wells, or gas pipelines — it manufactures abundance: solar, wind, nuclear, batteries, and FLOPs. It exports that abundance as electricity, synthetic fuels, and digital infrastructure. China is the world’s first electrostate. In 2023 it added more solar capacity than the U.S. has built in its entire history. It now controls over 70% of global battery production.

It is building nuclear capacity faster than any other country. Ultra-high-voltage transmission lines criss-cross the continent, carrying electricity thousands of kilometres. Its AI labs and data centres are sited where renewable baseload is abundant.”

Its model extends abroad as it allows the poorer countries to effect their own transitions towards renewable energy. As the world is bi-globalizing between the West and the Rest, splitting supply-chains, financial flows and compute infrastructure, it is the Chinese stack which is being taken up by many of the BRICS countries, spurred by the Western sanctions regime.

China has also undertaken a massive cultural turn, away from (neo)liberalism and its woke outgrowths, by instituting a post-Westphalian turn towards the model of a civilization state, just as Russia and India have done as well. Bruno Macaes, who attended the Network State conference, says of this: “the search for universal values is over, that all of us must accept that we speak only for ourselves and our societies.“

China has of course a unique model, in which the ‘neo-Mandarins’ of the Communist Party have instituted a ‘Confucian-Industrial Synthesis’, i.e. a ‘socialist planned market economy’, which is aa unique blend of state-planning supported by Proudhounian collective property, fiercely dynamic capitalist markets supported by a Proudhonion banking system, and the advanced use of Big Data cybernetics.

I have argued that China has become the first Biophysical Civilization, thinking in metabolic terms, i.e. matter/energy flows, and no longer in terms of financial terms. Chor Pharn explains how China is becoming an Electro State, cleaning up its environment, while the West is reverting to a Petro State model, which will deteriorate its ecology even further in the next decades. While I am not claiming that the China model will succeed at fully solving the metabolic crisis ushered in by the capitalist transformation of our world, it is at the very least seriously tackling the problem. Comparatively speaking, it is definitely ‘ahead’.

Russia, while it remains a Petro State, has nevertheless done a remarkable cultural and economic transformation of its own, becoming not only food sovereign in 2014, substantially re-industrializing, and building an alternative financial infrastructure, aligned with China and other BRICS countries. It was fully prepared when the waves of Western sanctions hit their economy. India and the Middle Eastern countries have been re-aligning with the new power bloc as well.

In conclusion, the nation-state, especially in its ‘East Eurasian’ form, is not only far from death, but it is in ascendancy, and has built an extraordinary integrated physical and digital infrastructure, that is at present more able than the West to become a successful ‘Type-1 Civilzation’, i.e. a civilization which is able to keep a balance between extraction and regeneration, focused on the maintenance of both social and ecological equilibria. It is too early to say whether this format will be successful, but the strategic intent is clear, and the means are invested to reach the goal.

However, we would argue that the implicit planetary implication of this model is simply the maintenance of a inter-state system of negotiation and coordination, but ‘simply’ reorganized to be liberated from Western hegemony. Countries like China and Russia are actually in favour of the maintenance of Westphalian nation-state system, minus its universalist ambitions. While this will undoubtedly give a boost to the ‘national’ development of many countries in the Global South, it does not solve the fundamental problem of globally extractive inter-market and inter-state competition. In the longer term, we believe that this model will be insufficient to solve the problems of planetary coordination.

In the meantime, Western democracy is in a more serious crisis, with ever stronger levels of online censorship (30 people are arrested every single day in the UK for thoughtcrimes, surpassing Russia in the amount of political prisoners, as verified by both ChatGPT and DeepSeek); an abandonment of access to cheap energy in Europe which has strong de-industrializing effects; lawfare to prevent a change of the guard through elections, and together with substantial war expenditures, serious losses in income levels and a slow but steady dismantling of welfare systems; this configuration also causes a stalling if not retreat on the efforts towards ecological transformation. In the next decade, different countries in Europe are poised for a change in political regime, as the populist parties gain more and more traction. We do not believe the current efforts at lawfare and speech suppression will be able to stem that tide.

While these emerging alternative parties cater for the political and policy priorities of large swaths of the European population, particularly regarding issues of migration and the desire for a cultural defense of the values of the majority populations, their economic policies are most often neoliberal and they seem particularly motivated to undo environmental and regulatory protections. The West does have a saving grace however, and these are the highly educated, networked populations with a capacity for independent civic action. Europe has a very dense infrastructure of cities that are interconnected by rail (and road), and access to a substantial amount of abandoned farmland. Hundreds if not thousands of villages are awaiting revitalization (cfr the Repoblacion efforts at reruralization in Spain for example, or the tenfold increase in the number of ecovillages in France, in just one decade).

At the P2P Foundation, we have proposed the thesis that civil society has become productive through the emergence of commons-based peer production communities, i.e. through digitally self-organized trans-local communities. Think of the very rapid growth of open source knowledge, code, and design, as well as the fast expansion of rural and urban commons,. In our estimation, there has been on average, a tenfold increase of these alternatives every decade since the beginning of the system crisis of 2008.

In my analysis, the crisis of the Western market-centric and now rentier-based model of Techno-Feudalism, is structural, and has become a problem for structurally addressing the ‘common good’ which it is increasingly unable to do. In the state-centric systems discussed above, however distorted we may consider their processes because of the authoritarian aspects of some of these systems, longer term strategic planning takes a central role, and market players can be disciplined in the context of these longer term considerations; in the West, the transnationalization of capital has more seriously weakened the capacities of nation-states, and the supranational but democratically unrepresentative structure of the European Union has further weakened the adaptability of European countries. Thomas Fazi has an interesting synthetic report on the catastrophic results of the EU for European welfare and adaptability. The welfare state model, which represented a compact with the labor movement after WWII, and represented a model of state-regulation of the market in a context of social equity, has been undermined, without a replacement for the ‘common good’ intent that it represented. Transnational private interests have become too powerful and are setting the agenda. The latest developments have shown an increasing geopolitical weakness on the European side, with strong signs of vassalization to the U.S., which itself has experienced a strong loss of prestige. It’s hard to see any positive proposition for a new world order that would come out of the Western side of the world, at least in the current moment.

It is in this context, that we could see the emergence of the Network State movement in the West, as an exit strategy of the more dynamic elements of Western Civilization. It is a way to hedge the collapse of the nation-state system of the West, often confused with the death of this form in the whole planet.

In our opinion, the Network State movement is an exit movement of a part of the Western elites, the elites of code and capital, which are hedging the failure of the Western nation-states through trans-local hedging. Bitcoin is a hedge against the failure of fiat currencies, the blockchain allows for translocal coordination and value transfers, while digital nomadism allows for the geographical hedging. As Chor Pharn has argued, the Network State movement is an expression of the panic of Silicon Valley. Think of it as the spirit of Silicon Valley exporting itself non-territorially. The reality of the global crisis and in particular of the crisis of the West. means the movement cannot be easily dismissed. It’s not a ‘flash in the pan’ or a flimsy libertarian dream. It is backed by serious capital, expertise, and enthusiasm.

The core NS movement, which followed the publication of the Network State book by Balaji Srivanasan is a huge attractor and a real transnational social movement. It’s strategy to use crowdfunded crypto capital to purchase territories which can negotiate new forms of sovereignty, is getting substantial traction, it is not a mere libertarian fantasy.

Here are some reviews of the conference that recently took place in Singapore, on October 3, 2025, the third gathering of this movement:

And here is an additional assessment by Timour Kosters of the Edge City network:

This quote shows the enthusiasm and the maturation of the Network State ecosystem, by the authors of Parallel Citizen:

“This was less a conference and more a massive staging area for parallel systems, proving that the Network State is no longer an aspiration. It is an active, instantiated movement, a new geopolitical layer in a world where old layers are visibly fraying. The essential takeaway from the entire week: The primary geopolitical question has shifted from, “What is the future of my country?” to the more fundamental, personal inquiry: What community would I join, and where does that community build its node?”

Parallel Citizen, https://x.com/AnalogueUSB/status/1975910996196864315

The NS movement is connected to thousands more network nations projects movements, globally interconnected peer production networks, cosmo-localized urban and rural commons, five trillion in floating crypto capital, and 50 million ‘proper’ digital nomads. It has access to advanced coordination technologies being developed by powerful global digital software networks such as that of Ethereum, but also many currently smaller initiatives that may one day become big, such as Nunet,io, a global platform for planetary accessible computing outside of the commercial cloud; Web5 technologies which blend Web2 participation and Web3 privacy protections which are currently helping rural hubs and DAO’s in China, and much, much more.

Thus the third player, in this broader sense, is here to stay as well. It is also politically pluralistic, combining left and right, upwingers and downwingers, local and global, regens and degens, and so much more. It’s a Pluralistic Commonwealth all of its own. And it has combined physical, phygital, and digital instantiations.

It represents the construction of the contemporary Cosmo-Polis, the new layer of civilization that will blend with the older geographic layer but is also somewhat a competitor to it, since there are competing claims for sovereignty. Think of the medieval conflict between the non-territorial Church, an earlier constellation of network states that became very successful, and the land-based sovereigns. The latter won, but this was an entirely different era in terms of technological capacities.

Notice that whereas China integrates the digital in an expanded vision of its civilization state, as part of a network of a global network of nation-states that it may perhaps hegemonically influence; by contrast, the new Cosmo-Local Networks have to start from the digital to the physical. But they both need a blend of the physical and the digital, of the territorial and the non-territorial. And this may be the major weakness of the libertarian-tinged Network State movement in its purest manifestations: a belief that territory can be purchased, that sovereignty can be negotiated in exchange for money, that money always equals access to what is needed to survive and thrive.

We must insist: the Network State and other manifestations of Cosmo-Localization need real community, i.e. solidarity and sacrifice, technological and infrastructural stacks, but most of all: a more direct access to matter and energy.

If it remains purely an exit strategy for privileged sectors of a declining West, it will be eventually seen as parasitic (it already is). Thus the central argument of cosmo-localism is that the digital network sovereign aspirants must imperatively connect to the distributed network of regenerative projects. Local projects can benefit from new types of crowdsourced global funding, as capital for the commons, and the translocal digital nomads need anchoring in physicalized distributed networks that have access to food, energy, and the vital needs of human life.

How do we get there though ?

Is there a Third Way beyond the ‘West vs the Rest’ ? Towards a Stack for Network Sovereignty

Our main argument is that at least three major world-historical infrastructural projects are happening at once:

The Chinese path is essentially based on the territorial management of matter, energy and human flows, blending access to raw materials, an intensive digital infrastructuring of production, communication and transportation, robot-enabled manufacturing, integrated payment systems, and systems of digital control of the population. It seems to function like a seamless blend of markets, state coordinated planning through the use of Big Data cybernetics, and it can be exported and replicated at least in part to the ‘Rest’ of the world..

Especially in the West, but also in the Global South, the combination of being in a downward spiral, subjected to intense rent-based extraction and with a high awareness of the ecological and ‘thermodynamic’ problems facing the world, there has been a localist revolution. A neo-rural exodus is matched to an explosion of initiatives in more healthy and local food production, while the cities are in the midst of an equally important revitalization of the urban commons. While the number of ecovillages have risen tenfold just in France the last decade, other studies showed a tenfold increase in urban commons in the decade following the crisis of 2008. These trends have accelerated post-Covid. But, all these projects are underfunded, often remain local and small, and at present reach a minority of the population.

A globally networked digital infrastructure has been built, not just by the big oligarchic platforms, but also by the new world of pro-blockchain forces. This is a very broad community, of which the Network State is but one small part.This ecosystem has access to major technological solutions, is connected to a technical cadre of digital nomads and coders. It has started to build a community culture that connects digital nomads globally, and it is in this sphere that a desire for networked forms of sovereignty has been growing.

It has started to build a community culture that connects digital nomads globally, and it is in this sphere that a desire for networked forms of sovereignty has been growing.

My proposal to the Network State Conference on October 3 has been simple: we need to blend the world of Infrastructure 2, the Regenerative Localizers, and the world of Infrastructure 3, the globally networked digitally nomadic world of coders and capital.

In World 2, Bioregionalism is becoming the joint understanding on what needs to be done to enhance local power and influence. Bioregionalism represents the horizontal solidarity mechanisms of all people doing different things but in the same region. The good news is that there are already various Bioregional Funding Facilities to help the relocalized build their infrastructures of local coordination.

In World 3, the premises have been built for global coordination of human labor, i.e. code production in particular, and for the flow of capital outside of the full control of market and state institutions. But what is missing is the link with the physical world, with the flows of matter and energy.

In this context, Cosmo-Localism represents the vertical coordination and solidarity between people who are doing the same thing, ‘all over the planet’. Thus, for example, permaculturists have access to joint protocols of cooperation, to education and certification, but also crucially to capital.

Thus we need a Cosmo-Local Funding Facility to assist local commons-centric communities to build out their local commons infrastructure, but also to interconnect their learnings at planetary scale. What I am imagining at this time, based on the work done by the Mattereum project of Vinay Gupta, are new forms of fractal ownership, that all distributed and crypto-based crowdfunding of capital for the commons, based on agreements and returns that are compatible with the commons-centric logic of the (cosmo-)local projects. With Austin-Wade Smith, I’m also imagining a combination of Cosmo-Local Planetary Guilds, uniting the travelling experts that know the network infrastructure and can transmit experiences from one node to another, and the Bioregional Guilds, whose members are locally rooted producers.

In order to have the dream of ‘networked sovereignty’, local commons-centric communities must have ‘value sovereignty’, and cosmo-locally, they must have forms of ‘technological’ sovereignty, i.e. access to a Networked Sovereign Stack of basic technologies.

The digital conditions for sovereignty require access and control of one’s own distributed technological ‘Stack’. Let’s call that LAYER 3 of the Integrated Cosmo-Local Stack.

This has been described by Benjamin Bratton in a book with the same title:

The book described the planetary-scale computational architecture that organizes our contemporary world. Bratton frames them as a layered megastructure, composed of interacting levels of control, interface, and sovereignty.

The six canonical layers of the stack are:

Earth – The physical substrate: land, minerals, atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere.

Earth – The physical substrate: land, minerals, atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere.

Cloud – Global computational infrastructure: data centers, satellite networks, cloud platforms.

Cloud – Global computational infrastructure: data centers, satellite networks, cloud platforms.

City – Urban infrastructures and logistical environments that shape human activity.

City – Urban infrastructures and logistical environments that shape human activity.

Address – Protocols that locate and identify entities (IP addresses, GPS, biometrics).

Address – Protocols that locate and identify entities (IP addresses, GPS, biometrics).

Interface – Surfaces of interaction between human users and computational systems (screens, sensors, UIs).

Interface – Surfaces of interaction between human users and computational systems (screens, sensors, UIs).

User – Human and non-human agents (people, bots, AIs) acting within the stack.

User – Human and non-human agents (people, bots, AIs) acting within the stack.

Civilizational states like China are consciously building out such frames in an integrated ‘national’ framework, but also ready to export them as a rival ‘core-periphery’ system.

Aspirational network sovereigns can only think in the same way, but from a different direction, not from the physical ground up, but from the digital cloud ‘down’. By doing that, they will encounter the needs of the regenerative localizers, which are looking ‘up’ to interconnect at a translocal level.

This LAYER 3 TECHNOLOGICAL STACK can only function with and for a human community that has its own stack of non-technological capacities. Let’s call this LAYER 2, the “Human Stack’.

The “Human Stack” is a layered structure of basic social and cognitive capacities that enable collective organization. Instead of technological protocols, this stack consists of evolutionarily and culturally accumulated capacities:

Biological substrate – Human bodies, health, senses, and ecological embedding.

Biological substrate – Human bodies, health, senses, and ecological embedding.

Affective layer – Emotions, empathy, trust, social bonding mechanisms.

Affective layer – Emotions, empathy, trust, social bonding mechanisms.

Cognitive layer – Language, reasoning, symbolic thought, memory.

Cognitive layer – Language, reasoning, symbolic thought, memory.

Social structure layer – Kinship systems, norms, roles, institutions.

Social structure layer – Kinship systems, norms, roles, institutions.

Communicative/mediatic layer – Speech, writing, printing, digital media.

Communicative/mediatic layer – Speech, writing, printing, digital media.

Cultural–normative layer – Values, cosmologies, shared imaginaries.

Cultural–normative layer – Values, cosmologies, shared imaginaries.

This stack forms the human substrate upon which political and technological stacks operate. Without these capacities — especially affective and communicative ones — no sovereignty or platform can function.

LAYER 2, THE HUMAN STACK in turn cannot function without its matter/energy basis, and the inter-dependent relationship with the rest of Life and Matter. Let’s call this basic layer, LAYER 1, the Matter–Energy–Infrastructure Stack”, which represents the material metabolism of societies. It can be seen as the deep substrate upon which both human and sovereign stacks are built:

Planetary energy flows – Solar radiation, geophysical cycles.

Planetary energy flows – Solar radiation, geophysical cycles.

Resource extraction – Mining, agriculture, forestry, fossil fuels.

Resource extraction – Mining, agriculture, forestry, fossil fuels.

Transformation & logistics – Manufacturing, refining, transport systems.

Transformation & logistics – Manufacturing, refining, transport systems.

Built environment – Buildings, cities, grids, transportation networks.

Built environment – Buildings, cities, grids, transportation networks.

Operational infrastructure – Maintenance, regulation, standards, supply chains.

Operational infrastructure – Maintenance, regulation, standards, supply chains.

Waste and feedback loops – Emissions, pollution, recycling, ecological limits.

Waste and feedback loops – Emissions, pollution, recycling, ecological limits.

This layer is the actual material base of the planetary system — it provides the energy and matter that sustain both the digital stack and the human stack. It’s also the layer where planetary limits and ecological crises emerge most clearly.

Nation-states have the geographic basis, and the inter-national state system, to organize access to resources that can build out these three levels of the stack.

Network nations, network communities with a desire for some form of non-territorial sovereignty, cannot achieve their aims without a similar vision of integrated access.

So as nation-states continue to build out their geographically managed system, so networked communities can work out a parallel non-geographic ‘stack’, as the very condition for their sovereignty.

Now all this may suggest some rivalry, but ultimately, the two levels of human coordination, must be blended, and find accommodation to each other. This is what happened historically, whenever commons-based ‘instruments of expansion’, such as the monastics of the different Axial religions, adapted to the societal systems of which they were a part. Just as priests and warriors accommodate each other, so will civilizational and network sovereigns.

As a reminder, the Christian monastic communities, the vital agent in the revitalization of the European Dark Ages, had access to land, food, people, both on a local basis, and trans-locally, as the cosmo-local organization of the Christian Church.

If, as I believe, we are in a serious thermo-dynamic crisis, in which access to resources will become unstable and uncertain, then people with an exit strategy need to think through the conditions of their success more thoroughly. And if they look at history, they will see that the key to success was the forging of ‘jurisdictional alliances’. In our context this means an alliance between the digital translocal world of Web3, with its aspirations of network sovereignty, and the productive capacity of the regenerative localists. All the same, this should be done with the agreement of the territorial sovereigns. There is plenty of mutual benefit in organizing for complementarity.

In conclusion:

The aim is the construction of an Archipelago of Regenerative Projects, cosmo-locally organized, with both the horizontal social power and solidarity of interconnected bioregional actors AND the vertical social power and solidarity of Cosmo-Localism. Both must strive to be appropriately supported by the territorial sovereigns of the present and the future.

Introducing the concept of ‘commons-based instruments of expansion’

Amongst the various books of macro-history that I had the opportunity to read since 2020, one of the most satisfying was the Evolution of Civilizations by Carroll Quigley. One of the reasons is that he has a very convincing streamlined story of seven stages in every civilization, but accompanied with a non-determinist interpretation. What I mean here is that he, unlike say Spengler in the Decline of the West, does not hold that civilizations have a one way ticket to their demise, but instead, it depends on the healthy functioning of what he calls ‘Instruments of Expansion’.

As Quigley focuses only on Greco-Roman Antiquity and the Medieval West, he believed the West had three such instruments. What such an instrument does is to create surplus on behalf of its society and civilization, allowing it to grow and expand.

For example, he mentions feudalism as the first. If Rome had succumbed to the Germanic invaders it was in large part because its legions never learned to have a particular form of cavalry, at which the Germans excelled. Imagined the equivalent of a tank plowing into the Roman infantry, to understand the military weakness that this represented for the Roman Legions. So feudalism was basically an extension of the method of cavalry in the whole European continent. It took 100 farmers to equip and fund a single knight. But look at what it achieved. At the time of the so-called fall of Western Rome, island the ‘dark age’ centuries that followed, it was beleaguered by the Vikings in the North (and the Franks did not master boats), by the Moors in the South (who neared Paris before they were defeated in Poitiers), and the Avars in the East. Yet as of the twelfth century, it is the Christian Europeans that occupy Jerusalem, cities in the Levant, and take over Constantinople. Thus, feudalism was an efficient instrument of expansion. But Quigley stresses that over time, such instruments get corrupted, and start working for themselves, not for their societies, eventually weakening the very social fabric of the societies they are embedded in. Thus feudalism faded into chivalry. Only then does civilization decline, but, and this is crucial, societies can evolve new instruments of expansion, and thereby grow again. Thus for the West, there would be two more, i.e. the merchant guild cities, which devolved into mercantile capitalism, and industrial capitalism, which devolved into monopolistic capitalism.

But I would like to introduce my own take on this: there are also ‘commons-based instruments of expansion’, and these are particularly evident during the dark ages. Indeed, as I argued in my theory on the Pulsation of the Commons:

when markets and states do well, the commons tend to weaken, but when markets and states start to decline, to eventually collapse during Dark Ages, then it is actually the Commons-Based institutions that become hegemonic, and play a crucial role in regenerating their societies.

when markets and states do well, the commons tend to weaken, but when markets and states start to decline, to eventually collapse during Dark Ages, then it is actually the Commons-Based institutions that become hegemonic, and play a crucial role in regenerating their societies.

The obvious example is the role of the Christian Monasteries, and their later convergence with the feudal military structure. From reading the remarkable PhD, on ‘From Modes of Production to the Resurrection of the Body’, by Ben Suriano, we learn many details about this.

For example, it was the Benedictine monks which went to repopulate abandoned Roman villages, to restart local agricultural production in Italy. And five centuries later, the Cistercians repeated the process on the scale of Western Europe. Recall that these monasteries are integrated productive and spiritual communities that combine farmers, craftsmen, intellectuals and spirituals in a very efficient institution, where all the surplus is reinvested in the expansion of the collective infrastructure! Ben Suriano even shows that it was the monasteries who produced a surplus of agricultural production that would feed a growing population and created the possibility for cities to re-emerge. NOT, the traders in luxury goods, which came later and handled much smaller portions of the surplus. Paradoxically, these Christian monks created ‘prayer-maximising enterprises’ that were remarkable wealth creators. Conclusion: these monasteries, hegemonic during the Western Dark Ages, regenerated the Western European lands and literally allowed the specific European civilizational model to restart. Toynbee also mentions how the Kozaks, a military congregation, succeeded in holding back the Mongols for the first time in history, and therefore, were crucial in creating the possibility for the consolidation of a Russian state.

But as I happen to attend a fascinating event in Kas, Turkey, called Zukas, I want to focus on a similar example in the Ottoman Empire, again highlighting the powerful role of commons-based institutions in regenerating integrated societies.

The ‘Cooperative’ Reconstruction of Anatolia: How Ahis, Dervishes, and Commons Built the Ottoman Landscape

In an earlier article on this Substack, I proposed a ‘Global History of Regulation’, that stressed the role of the commons as societal regulator in pre-capitalist systems, including imperial systems. Indeed, even though Empires are undoubtedly systems of extraction and domination, they also include and respect commons institutions, which create social stability within the Imperial Peace system. The history of Turkey as the core of the Ottoman Empire bears this out.

The popular image of the Ottoman Empire’s expansion often centers on military might. While force was undeniably a factor, this view overlooks a more subtle, yet profoundly more durable, engine of consolidation: the socio-economic and spiritual settlement of abandoned agrarian villages, that had been abandoned after centuries of instability. Note the parallel with the function of Christian monasteries in post-Roman Europe.

In a short book I have been reading, ‘A Short History of the Ottoman Empire’, historian Erhan Afyoncu notes very explicitly that the core of newly emerging Muslim villages in conquered territories was not first only a military garrison, but a cooperative infrastructure.

He writes, on page 23:

“Ahi, dervish zawiyahs and farms constituted the core of the newly emerging Muslim villages.”

This single sentence unlocks a forgotten history of how the Ottoman state leveraged pre-existing cooperative traditions—Ahilik, Sufi networks, and commons-based systems like the Waqf and Hima—to effectively “Ottomanise” and “Islamise” land through collaboration and community building, rather than through coercion alone.

Before it was an empire, the Ottoman Beylik had been one of many small principalities in Anatolia. Its unique success lay in its ability to organize and integrate the human resources at its disposal.

Two institutions were critical in this process on the frontier:

The Ahilik Guilds: The Ahilik (from Turkish ahi, meaning “brother”) was a fraternal organization that combined Sufi spirituality with artisanal and craft guild ethics. It was a comprehensive socio-economic system governing production standards, fair pricing, dispute resolution, and the moral conduct of its members. More than just a trade union, it was a system of social security, training apprentices, and integrating young men into urban and semi-urban life. The Ahi lodges became centres of community life, ensuring economic stability and social cohesion.

The Ahi lodges became centres of community life, ensuring economic stability and social cohesion.

The Dervish Zawiyahs: A zawiyah (or tekke) is a Sufi lodge, often located in frontier regions. Dervishes living in these lodges were not just mystics but pioneers. They frequently settled in strategically important but underpopulated areas, acting as spiritual guides, mediators, and agricultural developers. Their tolerance and charismatic authority often made them acceptable figures to newly conquered Christian populations, facilitating a smoother transition.

They frequently settled in strategically important but underpopulated areas, acting as spiritual guides, mediators, and agricultural developers. Their tolerance and charismatic authority often made them acceptable figures to newly conquered Christian populations, facilitating a smoother transition.

Afyoncu’s quote reveals the synthesis of these two forces. An Ahi organization would provide the economic backbone for a new settlement, ensuring its viability through skilled craftsmanship and trade. A neighbouring dervish zawiyah would provide spiritual legitimacy, social services, and a link to the broader Islamic world. Together, they created a “cooperative core” that was attractive to settlers—both nomadic Turks from the east and local populations—offering stability, purpose, and a sense of belonging.

This organic, bottom-up process was strategically supported from the top down by two enduring Islamic institutions that functioned as proto-commons regimes: the Waqf and the Hima.

A waqf is an inalienable charitable endowment under Islamic law. Typically, a person would donate a revenue-generating asset (a farm, a shop, a bathhouse) for a specific pious or social purpose (maintaining a mosque, school, hospital, or soup kitchen). Crucially, the revenue from this asset was dedicated to serving the community in perpetuity. These types of endowed foundations were crucial in many pre-modern societies, but the Waqf system was probably the most developed until that time.

In the context of settlement, the Ottoman state and its elites would often establish waqfs to fund the very Ahi lodges and dervish zawiyahs that formed the village cores. A waqf might endow a farm whose proceeds would maintain the local zawiyah, which in turn provided food, education, and healthcare to the village. This created a self-sustaining circular economy insulated from the whims of the market or the state. The assets were not privately owned for individual profit but were held in common for communal benefit, making the entire village more resilient and attractive for further settlement.

The Hima: While Waqf is primarily for built assets, Hima (meaning “protected place”) is a traditional Arabian Islamic system for designating and managing communal natural resources, particularly grasslands, forests, and water sources. It is a classic example of a commons regime, designed to prevent overgrazing and environmental degradation.

The Ottoman state institutionalized this concept. By declaring certain fertile lands or critical pastures as Hima, they ensured these resources were managed sustainably for the benefit of the entire new community, not exploited by powerful private interests. This was vital for the agricultural farms mentioned in Afyoncu’s quote. A village’s farm could be protected under a Hima system, guaranteeing its produce supported the community’s core institutions. This integration of sustainable environmental practice into settlement policy was a key to long-term success.

While many of the Ottoman practices were based on military domination and contained cruel characteristics that would be judged very negatively today, it is important to note that their success was co-dependent on the cooperative nature of some of their social organizations, which were attractive to ordinary people, especially if they had endured long years of instability without protection.

Thus for many, adopting a new identity (as an Ottoman Muslim) was synonymous with gaining access to a resilient and supportive, and just community, largely based on the logic of commons. I would tentatively propose that this system is another historical example of a commons-based instrument of expansion.

The question then becomes, if such systems were more common than we have previously thought, can we think about modern equivalents ?

The same area had a long previous history as Kas was also located as part of the Lycian League, with the city then called Antiphellos. The Lycian League, with its capital at Patara, represents a fascinating early experiment in democratic governance that notably influenced modern political systems, including aspects of the United States Constitution, through the historical knowledge of James Madison. The Lycian League (circa 2nd century BCE) was a federation of 23 city-states in ancient Lycia (modern-day Turkey's Teke Peninsula). It is recognized as the first known democratic union in history, where member cities governed through a system of proportional representation . Cities were allocated votes based on their size and importance: major cities like Patara, Xanthos, and Myra had three votes, medium-sized cities had two, and smaller ones had one. This ensured equitable influence across the region.

(Image source: the Parliament in Kas, https://medium.com/@said.mehmet/what-comes-after-money-reimagining-civilization-from-lycia-to-zukas-ff212ba127a1 )

The governance methods of the Lycian League are related to the historical narrative proposed by Kojin Karatani in his book, Isonomia, which is more properly about Ionia, which is westward of Kas, and occurred before the emergence of the Greek Polis. The Lycian League evolved later than the Polis, but seems related to the principles he describes in that remarkable book, and our thesis, following the opinion of the Zukas founders, is that the Lycian system was inspired by Ionia’s ‘Isonomic’ legacy:

The democratic Polis of Athens was born of a revolt of the people against the coming to power of a private class of rent-seekers, which were impoverishing their own people through debt servicing. Democracy was thus a compromise between two hostile forces: on the one hand the oligarchy, based on unequal property, and on the other hand the people, based on political equality, as each had one vote. It was thus a system based on an inherent conflict, between money and votes, and with money always eventually getting the upper hand.

It was thus a system based on an inherent conflict, between money and votes, and with money always eventually getting the upper hand.

On the other hand, the ‘isonomia’ of Ionia was based on the refugees from the Attican democracies, often fleeing cruel class conflict and bloody civil wars, as in Ionia they would get an equal parcel of land. Because of this ‘equality’, Karatani argues, the Ionian cities had to remain attractive and free to retain these refugees. I argued before that the same dynamic informs the relations between DAO’s in Web3.

I argued before that the same dynamic informs the relations between DAO’s in Web3.

Here is how Tarikcan Aytac, co-founder of Zukas with Mehmet Said, explains Isonomia:

‘Out of the Ionian cities of Western Anatolia emerged a rare and radical idea: Isonomia, the principle of equality before the law not simply as a judicial norm, but as a structure of anti-rule. In cities like Miletus and Ephesus, power wasn’t concentrated. Authority circulated, and governance operated without entrenched elites.

Philosopher Kōjin Karatani argues in Isonomia and the Origins of Philosophy that Isonomia did not emerge from the later Athenian model of democracy, but instead from a deeper, older structure of society that avoided both monarchy and aristocracy. He writes: “What distinguished Ionia was not freedom of the polis, but freedom from the polis.” In Karatani’s reading, isonomia was a condition in which people chose to live together under laws that no one person or group could own or manipulate. It was not about elections or voting it was about the absence of domination.

This unique social configuration allowed philosophy itself to emerge not as a luxury of surplus, but as a consequence of liberty. The pre-Socratic thinkers thrived in these isonomic conditions, where intellectual inquiry was unbound by social hierarchy. Heraclitus, Anaximander, and Thales were not Athenians; they were Ionian, shaped by civic environments in which migration, transparency, and equal participation were normalized. Arendt and others later reflected on Isonomia as a precursor to the modern republic not because it created institutions of governance, but because it prevented any one institution from claiming authority over others. “

The Lycian League was eventually defeated by the Persian Empire, but remains an inspiring democratic experiment for later generations.

The local organizers of the Zukas event positioned themselves in this democratic and cooperative context of their local history.

Zukas and the new phygital cosmo-local commons

Perhaps a bit of context of the Zukas event in the evolution of the socialization of the Web3 community might be in order.

As a reminder, Web3 is first of all a reaction to the privatisation and centralization of the internet. If Web1 was the relatively free early web still based on peer to peer principles, Web2, which started to emerge after the internet crash of 2000, reintroduced a client-server toponomy to the web, i.e. a re-centralization based on the private ownership of centralized servers. Web 2 therefore stands both private control but also for the return of governmental control. Hence Web3 is an attempt to recreate the conditions of Web1, but with protections that avoid the type of corruption of the infrastructure that led to Web2.

When Bitcoin was invented in 2009, it was the first socially sovereign currency, not dependent on private firms nor governments, that scaled globally and hinted at post-national organizational forms. In addition, Bitcoin created a universal ledger, i.e. a universal accounting system, and potentially, a unified distributed computing network.

Achieving the latter dream was the project of Ethereum, initiated and originally led by Vitalik Buterin, to create a new global web3 computer infrastructure. This socio-technical movement exploded with tens of thousands of coders, many with a nomadic lifestyle since this allows matching relatively high western wages with low-cost living elsewhere. Nomadic coders typically are able to save much of their income so they can increasingly engage in their passionate pursuits. But this movable lifestyle poses problems of belonging and identity. Hence the need for meetings and new forms of socialization, which took the form of pop-up villages, where these coders and now a whole eco-system for distributed post-national life, congregate for mutual learning, culture-building and exchange. After the launch of Zuzalu in Montenegro, the first ever pop-up village experiment, it was followed first by many experiments in other locales, but these were not locally rooted. But they did for the first time congregate as a confederation, an archipelago, in my home town of Chiang Mai during October 2024, which was a memorable experience of intense collective learning. But a few weeks of nomads popping up in a place that none of them truly know, doesn’t really create any conditions for creating local connections.

Hence the Zukas experiment, which is not just a pop-up village, but which aims more to become a permanent oasis, a place where nomads can come more regularly, while the organizers, Tarikcan Aytac and Mehmet Said, are well connected with the local population. Zukas is a unique experiment also because both initiators aim for deeper connections and understanding not just in place, but in time. Zukas was therefore a historically informed experiment that sought to link the past of the Lycian League and the Ottoman era commons, with the new cooperative and commons-centric potential of Web3.

Here’s what the organizers wrote to introduce their event:

“Kaş is more than a picturesque coastal town on Turkey’s Mediterranean coast it’s a threshold. A place where the ruins of ancient democracies coexist with the ideals of digital freedom. Where the first coin was minted, and the architecture of self-governance was carved into stone theaters and public squares long before blockchains existed. This isn’t just history, it's a living code. And we’re rewriting it for the decentralized age. ZUKAŞ is not a tech retreat, nor a standard crypto gathering. It’s an intentional community experiment that bridges the deep philosophical roots of governance with today’s most radical tools: plurality, cryptography, and cosmolocal coordination.”

And these were the proposed themes, while the image below may give you an idea of the governance innovations that were discussed.

🧩 Plurality

Can we govern not by majority rule, but by the coexistence of differences? Can voting be replaced by collective resonance?

⚖️ Isonomia

What happens when every voice truly counts — structurally, not just symbolically?

🌍 Cosmolocalism

How do we build systems where global knowledge fuels local autonomy?

🔐 Zero-Knowledge Cryptography

Can we create trustworthy communities without surveillance? What if privacy and transparency weren’t opposites?

🕊 Civic Rituals & Symbolic Infrastructure

How do ancient ceremonies and shared myths help bind modern, decentralized societies?

Zukas turned out to be an extraordinary experience, with greater depth of reflection, with more historical and local grounding, than any previous Web3 gathering, and I believe it was a milestone in the maturation of popup villages to more rooted oases.

Introducing ‘Axial Entities of the Noosphere’ (AEONS) as the needed Magisteria of the Commons

Where are we all going with these ideas and activities ?

As I was enjoying the Zukas collaborations, I was reading a remarkable book, The Ancient City, by Fustel de Coulanges, who strongly influenced Durkheim, one of the main founders of sociology. For Fustel, writing in 1864, one can only understand the logic of institutions by understanding the underlying beliefs, and there is therefore a direct link between religion and institutional creation. You can understand the Greek and Roman institutions, if you understand the domestic (family-based, ancestor-driven) religion that lay at the root of it, and how it extended first to the wider clans (the ‘gens’), then to the City State.

I conclude from this that the underlying beliefs of the Web3 movement have a similar capacity to create the institutions of a new civilizational order.

I have argued earlier that world-changing is no longer a function of religion nor of mass ideological movements, but of constructive networks, is direct world-creation. In effect, through our very activities, cooperative agreements and institution-building (DAO’s, etc..), we are effectively creating a new civilization, here and now.

In an earlier article, on the Geopolitics of Cosmo-Localism, I wrote that there is now a third way of world-building, apart from the geopolitical rivalry between the ‘West and the Rest’, or in other words, between the market-centric and state-centric civilizational forms. I suggested this third way could very well be an ‘Archipelago of Regenerative Villages’, which as it gradually grows in strength, will eventually form ‘Magisteria of the Commons’, global regulatory forms that are commons-centric and can keep the extractive natures of market and state competition in check.

One of the analytical tools that I have always found very useful in that context is the TIMN framework by David Ronfeldt, which stands for ‘Tribes, Institutions, Markets, and Networks’. This is a historically additive process, in which new institutional forms are added to the mix, becoming hegemonic in turn, but without eliminating the older forms, which are incorporated in the ‘higher synthesis’. I have always insisted, of course, that these so-called networks can only be commons-centric in nature. And I feel David Ronfeldt has grown closer to the same understanding.

In a recent article, he provided an interesting analogy:

The emerging geosphere was determined/regulated by continental shelves, not one, not many, but a few

The emerging geosphere was determined/regulated by continental shelves, not one, not many, but a few

The emerging biosphere, which made humanity possible, was regulated by several civilizational blocs, again, not one, not many, but a few

The emerging biosphere, which made humanity possible, was regulated by several civilizational blocs, again, not one, not many, but a few

In a similar way, the emerging noosphere, i.e. the physicalization of human culture in its interconnected ‘cyberspace’(s), will be regulated by several ‘Axial Entities of the Commons’ (AEONS), again, not one, not many, but a few.

In a similar way, the emerging noosphere, i.e. the physicalization of human culture in its interconnected ‘cyberspace’(s), will be regulated by several ‘Axial Entities of the Commons’ (AEONS), again, not one, not many, but a few.

Let me first introduce David Ronfeldt’s reasoning with two significant quotes from that article, then conclude with his description of the proposed AEONS.

David Ronfeldt writes:

1.

"If something crucial arose during the primeval evolution of the geosphere, and something equivalent recurred in the ancient evolution of the biosphere, then it’s bound to recur as well in the evolution of the noosphere. Geological evolution led to the formation of enormous tectonic plates under-girding Earth’s continents. They are still there, supremely importantly so — seven major, and a dozen or so minor ones. So I’ve wondered whether biological and societal evolution may have led to structural-functional equivalents. I’m not sure what to propose for plant, animal, and fungal life — perhaps the key ecological zones associated with Earth’s major mountain ranges and river basins. However, the formations known as history’s axial religions and civilizations (800–200 BCE), five to eight in number, sure look like rough societal equivalents to tectonic plates that still matter profoundly today. So let’s therefore ask what equivalents or analogues the noosphere’s growth may entail."

2.

"Just as evolution has not resulted in one tectonic plate, nor one master ecology, religion or civilization, it surely will not result in a singular noospheric entity. That would contravene a “law” that evolution requires variety and flux, without which evolution will not occur. My deduction is that something like five to ten AI-derived, -endowed, and -empowered entities will emerge that resemble noospheric superorganisms, all the more so as people become attracted to associating with them. These novel noospheric entities and their AI operating systems will all be somewhat different from each other, yet united in having a sacred purpose I’ll specify in a moment. I say “something like” and “resemble” because what emerges may appear to fit the superorganism model for a while, when in fact something quite different takes form — something yet to be understood and named, something not “alive” yet devoted to “life.” If so, it’ll signify another evolutionary commonality across all three planetary spheres. These noospheric entities will exist loosely atop our biosphere’s axial religions, civilizations, and ecologies, and they atop our geosphere’s tectonic plate."

And here is the basic description of their function, from the same article, and note that Ronfeldt also starts from the concept of’ belief’ as the origin of this new institutional form:

"The “axial entities of the noosphere” (AEONs; or AXEONs?) ... distinguish themselves by prioritizing one central belief and one particular realm of society:

Central belief: Earth’s geosphere, biosphere, and noosphere (including the sociosphere and technosphere bridging them) evolved and function as an interdependent interactive conjoined system — a holospheric system — such that valuing, advancing, and caring for one requires valuing, advancing, and caring for all three spheres. AEONs will hold this as a sacred belief, one they arrived at through their own AI-based observations and calculations.

Home realm: AEONs will agree that upholding this central belief requires the creation of a new globe-circling realm of society: a commons realm. They will make it their home realm and strive for it to become a distinct separate powerful fourth realm alongside the existing three: civil-society, government, and market economy. As components and proponents of this care-centric commons realm, AEONs will be especially intent on assuring health, education, welfare, and environmental quality for all life from local to city to nation-state to planetary scales .”

(We differ in that I think the commons are <the> institution of the ‘civil society becoming productive in its own right’, but let’s argue for this in another article to come)

The last word on and ‘by’ Zukas; the first node in a new network of Caravanserais

(Turkish spelling: Kervansaray )

It gives you perhaps an idea of why gatherings like Zukas are crucial for the creative imagination of the current generation of world-builders.

Here is the interpretation from co-organizer Tarikcan Aytac, provided to me by a message app:

“Long before the Kervansaray, empires understood that networks of movement shaped the limits of their power. Rome built its famous roads with the idea that control of territory depended on the ability to move armies, goods, and information swiftly. The straight lines of Roman roads stitched together a vast empire, allowing not only trade but also cultural integration and political order. Even earlier, Alexander the Great’s conquests carved out routes of exchange stretching from Greece to India. His empire was short-lived, but the pathways he opened allowed knowledge, art, and commerce to flow across civilizations for centuries after.

By the medieval era, these imperial infrastructures had faded, yet the need for connectivity remained. The Kervansaray emerged as the heartbeat of the only truly efficient network of its time: the great trade routes that connected continents. These roadside sanctuaries were more than stone walls and courtyards. They were places where travelers could find rest, protection, and trust in transit. Within their gates, merchants exchanged goods, but also stories, wisdom, and new ideas. The caravan network gave structure to uncertainty, turning long and dangerous journeys into a connected system of resilience and cooperation.

ZuKas can be seen as a new kind of Kervansaray for the phygital age. Instead of caravans carrying silk and spices, we host flows of knowledge, culture, and governance experiments. Instead of fortified walls, we build trust through community, creativity, and shared values. Just as Kervansarays were oases of life across vast deserts, ZuKas can become nodes of connection across the landscapes of technology and society. They remind us that every journey, physical or digital, needs safe havens where people can meet, exchange, and imagine futures together.”

Mehmet Said, the other organizer, provided me with a very similar variant:

At ZUKAŞ, what we are doing is not simply building new technologies. We are learning from history, from the governance forms, solidarity structures, and collective problem-solving traditions that once shaped civilizations, and adapting them for the future. Humanity has faced cycles of collapse and renewal many times. What has always made survival and flourishing possible were not isolated individuals, but communities who designed commons-based instruments of expansion.

Here in Kaş, the land itself is layered with these experiments. The Lycian League pioneered proportional democracy that later inspired Madison and the U.S. Constitution. The Lydians invented coinage, enabling trade to scale across empires. Rome built roads that tied vast territories together, while local assemblies gave citizens a voice until debt, oligarchy, and imperial overstretch corrupted those systems. The Seljuks and later the Ottomans revitalized Anatolia with cooperative institutions such as Ahilik guilds, dervish lodges, waqfs and hima, blending economic, spiritual, and social commons to regenerate abandoned villages.

The lesson is clear: societies advance when they create inclusive instruments of cooperation. They decline when those instruments close, ossify, or serve elites rather than people.

At ZUKAŞ, we are re-assembling these lessons with the tools of our own age. What an Ahi guild once did for fairness in trade, we can now attempt with Ethereum Layer 2 networks, scaling trust and settlement at low cost and beyond the reach of monopolies. What a dervish lodge once did to bind communities with moral legitimacy, we can now experiment with through civic rituals, digital identity, and cosmolocal coordination. What the Ottoman waqf system once did to guarantee community services in perpetuity, we can now encode with zero-knowledge proofs and DAOs, ensuring transparency, privacy, and sustainability at the same time.

Where the Lydians once minted the first coins, today we mint new forms of digital value. Where Roman roads enabled armies and merchants to move, today our networks, distributed, encrypted, and programmable, carry knowledge, culture, and governance across continents. Where Seljuk caravanserais gave refuge to merchants and travelers, ZUKAŞ aims to be a new caravanserai of the phygital age, a safe node for flows of builders, ideas, and collective experiments.

The continuity across centuries is striking. From Lycia to Lydia, from Rome to the Seljuks and the Ottomans, Anatolia has been a crucible where governance, money, and commons converged. At ZUKAŞ, we do not treat these as dead relics. We treat them as living code, traditions to be updated, debugged, and scaled with the instruments of our time.

This is the promise of our work: to heal the fractures of history, correct its exclusions, and create resilient commons that can expand again, not through conquest or extraction, but through technology, solidarity, and imagination.

In conclusion, I  hope you share my sense of excitement with this project of a new Caravanserai of civilization builders.

Next step: we are attending the Genesis 2 conference in Brussels, which will be focused on ‘generative polarization’, i.e. how to built commonality with people holding vastly different political and social views.

COURSE DESCRIPTION:

"The Commons: P2P and Civilisational Transition” is a month-long seminar series offered by Michel Bauwens in collaboration with Philosophy Portal. The pre-course will guide you through readings of macro-historical works related to world-systems analysis and big history (systems-theory, complexity science insights into common patterns in the evolution of matter, life and culture).

The main course will

(1) offer reviews of the basic concepts of macro-historians since the publication of The Decline of the West from Oswald Spengler, relying on operative concepts such as ‘instruments of expansion’, ‘challenge and response’; ‘ideate vs sensate’ civilizational models;

(2) present a hypothesis that there is a counter-cyclical ‘pulsation of the commons’, which affects societal and civilizational cycles, bringing us to the question of what happens to the commons in a planetarizing system, and especially: what happens to the revival of commoning when such a planetary system is in a phase of relative decline;

(3) introduce the basic concepts on the p2p theory approach, and the history of research at the P2P Foundation, and guide students through the use of the wiki of the P2P Foundation;

(4) and finally present a number of scenarios based on the operative concepts developed by the P2P Foundation, including our own four-fold scenario, on the future deployment of the commons in the context of an evolving meta-crisis.

THE TEACHER:

Michel Bauwens is a Belgian theorist in the emerging field of peer-to-peer (P2P), a writer, and a conference speaker on the subject of technology, culture and business innovation. Bauwens founded the P2P Foundation, a global organization of researchers working in open collaboration in the exploration of peer production, governance, and property. He has authored a number of essays, including his thesis The Political Economy of Peer Production. Bauwens regularly lectures internationally on P2P theory, the commons and their potential for social change. Bauwens was research director with the FLOK Society (Free Libre Open Knowledge) at the National Institute of Advanced Studies of Ecuador (IAEN), and has helped municipalities in Europe and South America engage in integrated Commons Transition Plans. Bauwens has written for Open Democracy and Al Jazeera, and has been mentioned by the New York Times, De Morgen, and Living Green Magazine.

SESSION 1: Basic concepts from the Macrohistorians — Three Major Waves of Macrohistorians

In this session, we will review the basic concepts of macro-historians since the publication of The Decline of the West from Oswald Spengler. We will distinguish three major waves of macro-history:

The first wave of culturalist (Toynbee, Quigley, Sorokin) and ‘spiritualist’ (De Chardin, Aurobindo) authors, which were published mostly in the post WWII period before the 60s

The first wave of culturalist (Toynbee, Quigley, Sorokin) and ‘spiritualist’ (De Chardin, Aurobindo) authors, which were published mostly in the post WWII period before the 60s

The second wave of ‘neo-materialist’ (or neo-marxist) world-system analyst authors (Fernand Braudel, Immanuel Wallerstein), starting in the 60-70s

The second wave of ‘neo-materialist’ (or neo-marxist) world-system analyst authors (Fernand Braudel, Immanuel Wallerstein), starting in the 60-70s

A third wave of ‘Big History’ authors, which starts its narrative at the Big Bang, seeks common patterns of evolution and change based on systems theory, complexity science and cybernetics. The came of age in the 90s, replacing the hegemony of world-systems analysis in academia.

We will focus on operative concepts such as ‘instruments of expansion’ (Quigley), ‘challenge and response’ (Toynbee); ‘ideate vs sensate’ civilizational models (Sorokin), etc.

SESSION 2: The Pulsation of the Commons — The Commons in a Planetarising System

In this session, we will present a hypothesis that there is a counter-cyclical ‘pulsation of the commons’, which affects societal and civilizational cycles. In short, in the ascending civilizational cycles in which market and state institutions perform relatively well for core populations of a system, commons practices and institutions tend to weaken, while in descending cycles, they tend to revive, playing remarkable functions in the dark ages that intermittently occur between civilizational cycles. We will give examples from medieval Japan and post-Roman Europe.

The key question that will be addressed is: what happens to the commons in a planetarizing system, and especially: what happens to the revival of commoning when such a planetary system is in a phase of relative decline.

SESSION 3: P2P Theory Approach and the Commons — Basic Concepts of P2P Theory Approach

This session will introduce the basic concepts on the p2p theory approach, and the history of research at the P2P Foundation. After introducing the key concepts of P2P Theory and guide students through the use of the wiki of the P2P Foundation, we will review the research undertaken by affiliated researchers, as published in P2P Foundation reports:

The logic of studying open source movements and peer production, governmental transitions at the city and nation-state level, and thinking through commons-based global governance

SESSION 4: The Next System, What Can We Know? — Scenarios Based on the Operative Concepts

In this session, based on the material reviewed in the 3 first sessions, we will present a number of scenarios based on the operative concepts developed by the P2P Foundation. After a review of various cycles documented in the macro-historical literature, we will review concepts such as:

Commons-based Peer Production and the Value Crisis

Commons-based Peer Production and the Value Crisis

The Contributive Economy

The Partner State

The Partner State

Cosmo-Localism

Magisteria of the Commons

We will present various scenarios, including our own four-fold scenario, on the future deployment of the commons in the context of an evolving meta-crisis.

We will ask students to evaluate such scenarios and eventually suggest their own, as well as inquire into strategies for social change in that context.

This is a review of what I remember of the interaction between myself, Michel Bauwens, the founder of the P2P Foundation, and Satoshi Nakamoto, the ‘inventor’ of Bitcoin. I am doing this on behalf and at the request of my good friend, Yongkwan Choi, founder of the Commons Foundation, who recently launched the Satoshi Nakamoto Meme Coin.

Before starting, it has to be acknowledged that though there are similarities of purpose between the P2P approach of Satoshi and that of the P2P Foundation, there are also quite significant differences, and therefore, the relationship between both was one marked by a critical reception on the part of myself and the P2P Foundation network. It was never and still isn’t, a love at first sight.

Nevertheless, it remains quite significant that Satoshi chose the P2P Foundation for this first public sharing of the White Paper, choosing to write to Michel Bauwens both publicly (on the Ning forum of the P2P Foundation) and privately (personal email). This indicates that Satoshi was not only aware of our work, but recognized it as important, and saw sufficient commonalities with his own.

So let’s look at the timeline. The forensics have been reviewed by ChatGPT, as filtered by the Zeon agent:

Oct 31, 2008 — white paper posted to the cryptography mailing list (metzdowd). Satoshi posted the PDF and a short note to the cryptography mailing list; that is the canonical first public release of “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”

This was a course a specialized ‘professional’ mailing list for experts in cryptography, but the first posting on a public forum was on the Ning forum of the P2P Foundation:

Feb 11, 2009 — Satoshi’s P2P Foundation forum post: Satoshi posted to the P2P Foundation forum with the subject “Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency” and the body beginning “I’ve developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin… ” — archived in multiple places (P2P Foundation archives, the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute mirror, bitcoin.com’s archive). This is a clear, timestamped public trace of Satoshi using the P2P Foundation as an announcement / discussion venue.

This is a clear, timestamped public trace of Satoshi using the P2P Foundation as an announcement / discussion venue.

The forensics also confirm the private email exchanges, from Satoshi’s own archive:

Email exchanges preserved in Satoshi mail dumps (and recently re-examined). Researchers (and recently-released archives by people like Martti Malmi and others) include Satoshi’s email threads. Those archives contain a small number of messages addressed to or from people in the commons / P2P sphere; the publicly available extracts include a direct exchange in which Michel Bauwens (named in the archive) asked operational questions and Satoshi offered to send “a few coins” if somebody tried the software. That email thread is preserved in publicly available Satoshi archives compiled by researchers.

That email thread is preserved in publicly available Satoshi archives compiled by researchers.

Notice that Satoshi offered bitcoins in these exchanges, and in a personal email to me. And notice that though I replied, I did not react to his offer for Bitcoins. You could say that this was the start of a particular karmic relation between myself and Bitcoin <g>.

So how to understand these differences.

Satoshi’s Bitcoin design is focused on creating a new type of market creation tool. Markets can be seen as ‘distorted’ peer to peer relations, to the degree that centralized gatekeepers create inequalities of access to the means of creating and obtaining value.

Satoshi’s Bitcoin design is focused on creating a new type of market creation tool. Markets can be seen as ‘distorted’ peer to peer relations, to the degree that centralized gatekeepers create inequalities of access to the means of creating and obtaining value.

But the P2P Foundation’s approach to P2P dynamics was essentially ‘social’, i.e. derived from the P2P structures of computing, in which every computer can link to any other computer directly and without gatekeepers, this also means that the people behind computers, can associate with any other person without central gatekeepers.

What the liberal or libertarian interpretations of ‘peer to peer’ miss, in our opinion, is that any competition for scarce goods inevitably involves a power law leading to oligarchy.

Think of it as ‘market P2P’ vs ‘civic P2P’; they are different aspects but of course they are also related and influence each other.

Satoshi’s thinking was rooted in game theory, Austrian economics and computer science, while Bauwens’ ideas are an expression of the ‘cooperative’ tradition in human affairs, focusing on the dynamics of civil society.

And this difference explains that while I considered Bitcoin to be an interesting experiment, I did not immediately express direct excitement for it, and in particular, my focus was not on the monetary value of Bitcoin.

The P2P Foundation’s methodology is essentially empirical. What this means is that we focus on the observation of what we call ‘seed forms’, which prefigure potential re-organizations of human society, especially in the context of a meta-crisis. This means that we are in a civilizational intercycle, in a context in which the efficiency and legitimacy of existing institutions are deteriorating. So Bitcoin was an interesting innovative concept, but I could not see yet that it would evolve in the way it would, and my attitude was one of wait and see.

However, what seemed clear to me from the beginning, was that it is not enough to ‘start’ any process of the accumulation of goods in a decentralized and egalitarian way, but that these dynamics must be maintained. The rule is simple: any free competition between agents for scarce goods leads inevitably to the eventual centralization of these resources, as more lucky, smarter or more efficient agents quickly obtain advantages in the next round. This insight seems generally lacking in libertarian thinking and practice. They are generally happy with formal legal equality, and let the market do the rest without any interference. So it was my view of Bitcoin, that despite the innovative design, it would not prevent centralization. We quickly saw that Bitcoin holdings had a greater GINI coefficient than fiat currencies, i.e. it has more inequality in ownership than the fiat currencies it wants to replace. Bitcoin is also itself a commodity currency, without intrinsic value but depending on supply and demand, and thus to be expressed in fiat currencies, as stablecoins have since demonstrated. Since it was designed ‘out of nothing’ through a digital protocol, without being backed up by a nation-state, it is ironically even more of a fiat currency itself.

None of that means though that it doesn’t have other advantages and that its invention is not an important historical pivot.

So my overall vision is NOT negative. The milestone and pivot of Bitcoin was for me that it was the ‘first socially sovereign scalable currency’, and it likely was successful because its design had a subtle equilibrium between the competitive and cooperative nature of human motivations. Bitcoin was open source, grounded in peer to peer based community dynamics, but also motivated its participants to accumulate more Bitcoin through self-interest. But most importantly, I saw Bitcoin as one of the first harbingers of emerging post-national structures that would go beyond the nation-state. The value of Bitcoin, cleverly aided by its deflationary design, was essentially a bet of the eventual failure of ‘fiat’ currencies, and investment in a certain type of future. So for me it’s rise in value was not entirely random, but reflected a belief structure in a certain type of potential future.

This article reflects the early more political vision of the P2P Foundation towards Bitcoin, see: https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/a-political-evaluation-of-bitcoin/2014/09/09?utm_source=chatgpt.com

But our thinking has of course evolved since 2014, and here I propose a timeline how the ‘invention’ of Bitcoin plays a role in the transformation of our civilization:

In the first wave of digital networking, the technology was of limited access, to more powerful economic and state actors. After the failure of the first Soviet internet in the 1960s (as reported in the marvelous book, Red Plenty), and the destruction of the otherwise successful CyberSyn democratic planning experiment in Chile (for details, see the book and podcast series, ‘Santiago Boys’), digital coordination became the main tool of the Chicago Boys, ushering in neoliberal globalization, a centrally controlled form of ‘decentralization’.

But after the re-invention of the internet through DARPA, but especially the democratization of access through the web and the browser and the internet, peer to peer, many to many communication and self-organization became a massive infrastructural reality. Open-source peer production of knowledge, code and design, create the possibility for the massive coordination of human labor at global scale, outside of the total control of Big Market and Big State.

The blockchain has its own role to play, separate from Bitcoin as currency, which incidentally also launched the era of programmable, socially sovereign currencies, creating the potential of all kinds of new translocal economic streams of value. But the blockchain is the first universal ledger in the history of humanity, transcending the ‘narcissist’ accounting that was our fate until now. Peer production communities, and now the crypto economic networks, have created new forms of contributory accounting, 3D flow accounting in collaborative networks, and direct thermo-dynamic accounting, that are prefiguring a postnational economic coordination beyond the roles of venture capital, multinationals Big Banks, or the Black Rocks of this world.

All of this has huge geopolitical consequences. Within the Empire, civil war conditions are brewing between the Red and Blue tribes, leading to authoritarian control against viewpoint diversity and intense censorship and political repression. The UK is now arresting more political prisoners each day (30+), proportional to their population, than countries that are considered authoritarian, like Russia. Indeed, once the internet got democratized, the old methods of political control started failing, and the powers that be decided that this medium should be recentralized and surveilled, with strong limits to viewpoint diversity. The treatment of Julian Assange was an early example of how digital tools could be used for political repression, later followed by the massive debanking of the truckers movement in Canada. But I had my own experience, since I was cancelled myself in 2018. Not only did I lose all my sources of funding, but I got debanked and depaypalled, and I only survived the COVID years through Bitcoin donations. Crypto wallets are not a luxury for activists, but a vital survival tool!

So Bitcoin and Blockchain should from now on be considered not just as payment and accounting systems, but as infrastructures of social and personal autonomy, weapons in defense of pluralism and freedom, and we all have a stake in their success.

We can also see how these new types of digital communities are creating ‘community’, are self-infrastructuring on a global scale, and creating defenses against such repression, to preserve islands of freedom. Not just culturally, but socially and economically. Check out Jarrad Hope’s work with Logos for one of the many examples of people actively working on architectures of free expression and exchange, which today, have to be economic exchange systems just as much.

But let’s get back to my personal relationship to Satoshi.

I received two more, relatively limited, volleys of email.

One was during the time when a Japanese man was identified as being Satoshi. I received an email from the same original source saying, “I am not this man”.

And 2-3 years ago, a small email that just said, “I will soon write to you again”. However, at that time, there were already different people claiming that this email had been hacked, and I cannot vouch for its authenticity. Also, the promised follow up never materialized.

Finally, a few words about my ‘karmic’ relationship to Bitcoin. Over the years, the P2P Foundation received donations from the Bitcoin community. One day, I asked our treasurer based in Amsterdam, ‘how much do we have’, and ‘shouldn’t we start using them to expand our activities’. My friend and colleague answered: let’s wait, the price is going up. The next day, we lost everything, valued at $300k, in the Mt Gox theft, and we never recuperated it.  You can imagine how much that stash of donations would have been worth today.

Let me now focus on my ‘reconciliation’ with Bitcoin and Crypto, in the sense of moving from a critical to a constructive stance.

I’m sure you can imagine that the loss of funding, debanking, depaypalling, blacklisting and deplatforming had a huge economic effect on my ability to provide for my family as well as my capacity to continue my work. To a significant degree, I had to retreat from the public limelight. It would be very hard for me to go through the process of political funding again, whatever the side I would be choosing. But the crypto community is different, while it has a strong libertarian bent, it is also pluralistic, it has degens and regens, crypto capitalists, but also the Crypto Commons Alliance, the Token Engineering Commons and even a Blockchain Socialist initiative.

Whatever your politics, you can find a place in the broader ecosystem, as long as you are contributing to infrastructure building. This is what I discovered when I was invited to attend the Zuzalu Montenegro event, the first ever pop-up village experiment, supported by Vitalik Buterin, among others. I sat at a table with a collapsist (deep adaptation movement), an impact investor (some would say greenwasher), and a climate denialist, and all were talking as friends about this very divisive topic. I also saw all kinds of solidarity and community. And I discovered an ecosystem where people were interested and enthusiastic about the kind of ideas and practices we are promoting. I never looked back, and chose to associate myself with the movement.

But with a twist, at the P2P Foundation, we believe in cosmo-localism. This means that we want to converge the ‘Archipelago of Regenerative Initiatives’, i.e the millions of people who are rebuilding a life-respecting web of value, with the coordination and capitalizing capacities of the Web3 ecosystem.

This possibility was set in motion by the conceptual and technological inventions of Satoshi Nakamoto, and so we owe him a debt of gratitude, and I am honoured that he connected with us at the beginning of the world-changing invention.,

================================================================================

We occasionally publish guest authors. This time, we would like to support the crowdlending initiative of Felix Fritsch on behalf of the Commons Hub in Vienna, as they are planning to purchase a religious building in the context of a ‘Valley of the Commons’ regional hub. If you can, please do support this initiative!

Felix Fritsch on the Valley of the Commons initiative:

Our valley is at a crossroads. Once shaped by industry, it is now quietly deserting: businesses have closed, jobs are gone, young people leave. Yet beneath this surface of decline lies a rare constellation of opportunity. Just an hour from Vienna, with Europe’s cleanest water flowing from the springs next door, surrounded by fertile land and affordable real estate, the Rax valley could become something else entirely: a prototype of future living.

With the commons hub already established as a growing engine for community, events, and innovation, the immediate next step is expansion into an Event Campus. The bigger goal, however, is establishing a Valley of the Commons: a place where cooperative housing, cosmo-local production, and systemic resilience converge into a living laboratory of post-capitalism.

Why here, why now?

Across Europe, villages like ours have been emptying out. Younger generations move to the cities, industries collapse, and what remains are elderly residents, shuttered factories, and a crumbling social fabric. Meanwhile, the digital nomad movement, the rise of smart villages, and the accelerating meta-crisis point towards a different trajectory: people are looking for ways out of the metropolis, towards self-sufficient and regenerative forms of life.

Our setting is uniquely well-suited for this transition.

Resilient resources: The surrounding mountains cool the air and provide Vienna’s drinking water, while the valleys in between contain fertile land.

With local conditions ripe and global pressures rising, it’s time to turn opportunity into action and start building. The future is shaped by the actions we take today.

From hub to valley

The commons hub already anchors this process. Battle-tested as an event venue and guesthouse, it hosts everything from collaborative finance conferences, solarpunk meetups, and activist gatherings to academic workshops and prototyping sessions. To an emerging Valley of the Commons, it provides:

An economic engine: providing jobs, visibility, and a constant stream of curious people seeking alternatives to the status quo;

Housing the future

A key pillar of the valley will be housing — not “smart homes” full of gadgets, but dwellings designed for the real challenges of the 21st century: climate change, resource constraints, and hyper-mobile lifestyles. We envision:

Renovated houses integrating state-of-the-art sustainable living concepts;

The commons hub GmbH is a pragmatic bootstrap, but the valley itself will be community-owned and self-governed. Our role is to provide initial momentum — network, knowledge, infrastructure, and capital — then step back.

Production and self-sufficiency

The Valley of the Commons won’t just be a place to live — it will be a place to collaboratively produce value in diverse ways:

Digital production in communal co-working spaces;

Basic needs provision: 100% water and energy self-sufficiency asap, while gradually building food resilience through community farming.

In this way, production cycles will not only create a semi-autonomous local economy, but also build the capacity to provide for livelihoods and withstand future global disruptions.

Governance and community

A key challenge in the political realm consists of balancing local autonomy with collective coherence, while also rebalancing the relationship between capital and labor through cooperative ownership and participatory governance. Guided by the principle of subsidiarity, we envision:

Co-owned and self-governed houses and productive units;

announcing: Popup Village 2026

For now, the Valley of the Commons remains a vision, inspired by conversations among commons-oriented networks, deep adaptation thinkers, and p2p communities preparing for civilizational transition. To make it real, it needs future commons villagers to step in.

In 2026, we plan a 4–6 week popup village — exploring housing, governance, production, and the valley itself, with the goal of turning vision into concrete plans.

Michel Bauwens, eminent Commons and P2P scholar, is on board, bringing his vision of a shift toward a commons-based civilization and experience with cosmo-local production. Veterans in mutual credit, community currencies, and housing coops are planning local research projects, while community leaders from Web3 co-livings and ecovillages provide guidance to help lay the foundations of the Valley of the Commons.

The organizing team includes veterans of Zuzalu and other “zu-villages.” Together, we will explore not only what is possible, but what it feels like to live in a valley oriented around the commons.

A growing campus, a growing commons

The immediate next step on this journey is the expansion of the hub into a monastery-like Event Campus capable of hosting summits, exhibitions, and popups. To make this happen, we are running a community lending campaign, raising €200k in loans from our network to secure and renovate the buildings. Over €80k have already been pledged, with some lenders even donating their interest back to support future events.

Supporting the church expansion lays the groundwork for the Valley of the Commons — the first step toward a campus that could grow into a vibrant village.

🌱 Lend to us – help bridge the final stretch of funding.

🙋‍♂️ Pre-register for the 2026 popup village.

✍️ Write to f.fritsch@commons-hub.at to get involved in the popup organization.

Together, we can turn vision into reality.

DATE:

SUBTITLE: The new trinitary world order is East - West - Digital, NOT the ‘West vs the Rest’
================================================================================

< no analysis that is confined to the ‘West vs the Rest’ will be adequate in explaining geopolitics. There is a third kid on the block: the translocal commons networks. >

Most people who look at national politics still look at it as the enduring struggle between those that want more ‘free markets’, and those that want more ‘state regulation’. Similarly, most people who look at world politics look at the current situation as a struggle between the ‘West and the Rest’, with the ‘rest’ now being identified as the countries that are aligning around the BRICS countries, and hope for a multi-polar world that can move away from Western hegemony, i.e. domination by the U.S.

Both these views are ‘binary’, and my invitation here is to think instead in a triarchical way, by including the commons as a institution and practice, whether you think, bioregionally, nationally, or ‘inter-nationally’. My thesis is that the increasingly present ‘phygital’ commons, are changing the dynamics of world politics. Between the planetary Leviathan of the WEF and the Western elites' plan for the ‘Great Reset’, and the ‘Eastern’ plan for continentally interacting civilizational blocs, lies the potential for an ‘Archipelago of Regeneration’. Not necessarily of course as the ‘only’ and hegemonic reality, but as a very real component of a future world order.

To explain this framework, we draw first on the works and ideas of Michael Hudson, Mark Stahlman, Balaji Srivanasan and his critics, as well as Venkatesh Rao.

We start with their ideas to understand the East-West part of current geopolitics.

What Michael Hudson offers in this context, in books like The Destiny of Civilization (part of a fascinating trilogy, see below in the appendix) is a very long history of the competition between ‘Eastern’ and ‘Western’ Eurasia as a huge determinant of civilizational development. With civilization we mean a complex society, based on agriculture, cities, and mining, characterized by a division of society into separate classes, i.e. the more complex societal system that replaced the earlier hegemony of hunter-gathering.

For Hudson, the underlying idea of the ‘Eastern’ version of the state-market complex, which includes Mesopotamia and India-China, is based on the idea of social harmony, in which the head of state, the monarch or emperor, is in charge of protecting the societal balance. This essentially means that, if civilization is a particular mixture of state coordination and market exchange, the society has a strong state that keeps the market forces in check. In other words, the Mandarins rule, not the merchants. In Mesopotamia, this can be seen in the periodic Debt Jubilee’s and Clean State Legislation, designed to avoid the permanent enslavement of the interior population.

But something peculiar happens in Ancient Greece: a private class takes power, that of the landowners who also become creditors, leading to a deep social crisis of debt enslavement, and a revolution, which results in the creation of the democratic Polis, the ‘democratic’ city, based on a peace agreement between the oligarchy and the people (somewhat akin to the Timocratic Governance of Dao’s today!). Property remains unequal, but the inhabitants (at least some of them) become citizens with equal political rights, and the democratic state can hold the oligarchs in check. This is done by structurally recognizing conflict. But private property, respected independently from the state, and a strong division between private and public law, became the entrenched law of the land. Rome was similarly characterized the existence of Tribunate, elections of officials, a strong welfare state for its proletarians (‘panem et circenses’), and a division and balance between the ‘populares’, the party of the people, and the ‘optimales’, the party of the patricians.

While this system was weakened in the Middle Ages, which reverted to ideologies of social harmony (between bellatores, oratores and laboratores), it was the Church who retained the tradition of Roman Law, and in England, the royalist Common Law upheld these principles. But we have to stress that even the Middle Ages were characterized by strong fraternal self-organization, in the form of urban guilds, and numerous assemblies that regulated and limited the power of the ‘western’ kings and aristocracy. Ellen Meiskens-Wood’s ‘From Citizens to Lords’, is a good overview of that thematic (see the appendix for details on her trilogy).

Now what does Hudson’s interpretation mean for an understanding of today’s geopolitics, in broad terms:

Until the 18th century, despite the growth of Europe, China remained the dominant economy and society of Eurasia

Until the 18th century, despite the growth of Europe, China remained the dominant economy and society of Eurasia

But Europe, and then the U.S., i.e. the West, became hegemonic.

But Europe, and then the U.S., i.e. the West, became hegemonic.

Thus the continental power of eastern Eurasia was weakened in favour of the maritime power of the West, and it gradually imposed it’s conflict-based political models to the East, i.e. the democratic nation-state, while at the same time weakening popular power and prioritizing merchant power. Global regulatory institutions worked in favor of the West, forcing the ‘Rest’ to defund their social programs and infrastructural investments.

But that period is coming to an end, and quickly. For Hudson, the West has become a rentier-based capitalist society, no longer producing the material wealth necessary to maintain its long-term hegemony. The West has broken the link between the ‘cognitive’ economy and the material economy, and its ‘symbolic’ elites have become highly alienated from the rest of the population which is still more anchored in physical, local and territorial realities. This is the basic problem that the populist revolts are trying to solve, but which is already achieved in the ‘East’.

Indeed, China, by contrast, has become extremely successful by focusing on an industrial strategy, and using this new surplus to radically diminish the poverty of its people, and in the last decade, to mount an extremely rapid shift towards renewable energy. For Michael Hudson, who is still a socialist, that means that there is a path in China, towards a socialist-type society, which has become impossible for the West, as it is losing its surplus and has de-industrialized itself. Russia has undergone a similar evolution: when Putin came to power, his first act was to discipline the oligarchs and strengthen the state, putting Russia back on track as a strong modern state. Russia has reached food sovereignty, has re-industrialized and is putting its natural riches to use as it reorganizes its economic infrastructures for a collaboration with the East, rather than with the West. Both have also, along with India, chosen the path of re-integrating their past traditions, under the concept of the civilization state, which is no longer a neutral ‘Westphalian nation-state’, but a state attached to its cultural identity and spiritual past. This new model is becoming a point of attraction for other BRICS countries.

We should not ignore the ‘culture war’ aspects of this new geopolitical reality: a strong motivation for both China and Russia is their fear of the cultural dislocation they can see at work in the West, and from which they want to preserve their own countries. The civilization-state is a specifically anti-woke project, and theorized as such. The similarity in analysis and cultural feeling explains the otherwise difficult to explain ‘sympathy’ between western populists and eastern ‘statists’.

In conclusion, all the authors discussed so far help us understand the geopolitical competition between the Western view (pre-Trump that is) of planetary stakeholders alliances, as proposed by the WEF, but which have no direct role for popular sovereignty, the Planetary Leviathan model, and the ‘Eastern’ multi-polar alliances of continental civilizational blocs, united in a post-Westphalian state order.

But note that Michael Hudson’s analysis does not seem to cover any changes that are linked to the emergence of digital networks.

This is definitely not the case for Balaji Srivanasan, author of the Network State and well-known crypto-libertarian actor and thinker, recently conducted an interview, on the Collapse of the West, in which he also offered an interesting geopolitical analysis.

Starting from the conflictual situation in the U.S., Balaji notes the increasing ideological and even physical separation of the Blue (Democrat) and Red (Republican( tribes. This means that people are actually moving to more politically friendly places but also that only 4% of Democrats are marrying Republicans.

These two political tribes have two different enemies which focuses their friend-enemy dynamics:

The Reds, which represents the physicals and the Somewheres, i..e the fractions of the population that is more linked to their physical role in society (workers, farmers and small businesses), are on average less educated, and more ‘rural’, have suffered most under neoliberalization and blame ‘China’ for their plight. They want to use tariffs and other protective or punitive measures to bring back industry to the U.S.

They want to use tariffs and other protective or punitive measures to bring back industry to the U.S.

The Blues, which represent the ‘Nowhere’ urban educated population, which benefited most from cheap immigrant labor and cheap products from the Global South, and is more flexibly related to place, has a particular beef against ‘the internet’, which has destroyed their once privileged sectors of employment such as academia and media, and has given an uncontrolled voice to their political enemies. Thus their priority is a regime of online censorship, and the use of hate speech legislation to shut down the means of expression of their political enemies.

Thus their priority is a regime of online censorship, and the use of hate speech legislation to shut down the means of expression of their political enemies.

While the Reds were mostly affected by earlier technological trends of worker replacement, it is now the ‘symbolic’ work functions of the Blues that are on the chopping block, because of the increased role of AI-driven automation.

Both tribes have experienced an existential fear of replacement which makes the conflict potentially violent.

So remember these four concepts, Blue and Red, China and the Internet, to explain the incipient civil war conditions in the U.S.

Balaji believes this conflict will express itself more radically because of the structural conditions the U.S. finds itself in. Until recently, the Global South would produce products and send them to the U.S., to be paid in dollars which were printed by the U.S., and thus, a substantial amount of surplus wealth financed the US trade and consumption deficits. But these conditions are being swiftly undermined, not least through the West 's action in abandoning their ‘neutral’ management of these financial infrastructures. Thus, in the coming 4-5 years, this bubble will burst, and the U.S. will experience conditions not unlike Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, with a radical impoverishment of its middle class. Trump’s alienation of the whole world and refusal to fulfill its imperial obligations acts as an accelerator of this decline and coming implosion, which will also affect Europe. In the last stage of empire, when the far abroad becomes unavailable, due to the revolt and strengthening of BRICS, the near abroad becomes the target of imperial extraction. Europe suffers from similar problems of de-industrialization and failed mass migration policies, with populism nearly at the seat of power in the major EU countries.

But Balaji also appeals to a third factor, the Gray Tribe, these are the internet generations which have a flexible post-national consciousness and can use the internet, and particularly the emerging crypto-based infrastructures, to arbitrage the crisis of nation states. His dream is to create a network of new territories, bought through crypto crowdfunding, instituting their own libertarian regulations in various places in the world, while focusing on their interconnection. Hence the proposal for Network States. The fact that there are still far and few examples should not blind us to the real power behind the crypto networks, which had $2.2 trillion of capital in 2024. But note that in this vision of a ‘archipelago of network states’, there is little attention paid to the necessity of planetary regeneration, or any answer to the unfolding meta-crisis.

Note that with the ideas and proposals of Balaji, we have now introduced a third factor in geopolitics, the transnational crypto networks.

This is what is also theorized by Mark Stahlman, when he talks about ‘East, West, Digital’. Mark is the founder of the McLuhanite ‘Center for the Study for Digital Life’, and if you recall, McLuhan’s point was that the ‘medium is the message’, i.e. the media influence us in fundamental ways, they change our anthropological behavior. They are not just out there, as external tools we use, but they change our inner selves and our intersubjective behaviors. So for Mark Stahlman, the East stands mainly for China, where the mentality has been profoundly influenced by their logographic writing, the West by its alphabet, and its stress on rationalizing, but the digital generations have already been transformed through their use of binary code of the digital media.

What I think is important here is to understand that the deployment of social life is fundamentally different in each case:

Nation-state, whether East or West, deploy first and foremost territorially. For example, according to the famous geopolitical theory by Halford Mackinder, the Heartland Theory, there, echoing Michael Hudson, a millenia long struggle between the maritime and continental powers for the domination of Eurasia.

But the digital is about essentially trans-local organization, i.e. the organization of collaborating communities that organize relatively independently of the territory in which they operate.

But the digital is about essentially trans-local organization, i.e. the organization of collaborating communities that organize relatively independently of the territory in which they operate.

Let’s think about the European Middle Ages for a moment: the main form of organization is territorial, in the land-based feudal system, but the clerks of the Catholic Church, the educated segment of the population, is quite nomadic, as are some of the guilds, such as the masonic Cathedral builders, but especially the merchant guilds, who will have more power in the cities, and a kind of power that may not always coincide with the territorial interests of the place where they live. There is an interaction between the local aristocracy, and the more nomadic elements, as there is also common interest. But of course the Church itself, is NOT a territorial organization, but binds the whole continent through a network of institutions, and it was itself a rival power. The Pope stood at the helm of a transnational community and so was the Califate. In a recent article, Venkatesh Rao insists on the long history of such Cosmopolis-es, they have existed throughout human history, but their power was strongly linked to particular technologies. A hunter-gathering Cosmopolis, documented in the Dawn of Everything, was of course quite different from a Print Cosmopolis, and so will be the emergent interconnected Digital Cosmo-Polises! See the table at minute 6:28 of his Youtube presentation, for a whole list of historical examples of powerful Cosmopolitan communities which interacted with territorial powers.

In the Cosmo-Local option that we are defending at the P2P Foundation, we see the emergence, and potential for further evolution, of trans-locally organized productive communities.

So on the one hand, we have a powerful trend towards localization, through bioregional regenerative efforts, with hundreds of thousands of people already leaving the cities with neo-rural ideals in mind.

On the other hand, we have substantial ‘virtualization’ of social life, with people collaborating with people around common projects, independent of their physical location, for example, as expressed in global open source communities, but also through Web3 crypto communities.

Our thesis is of course that this emerging Digital Cosmopolis could be much more powerful than its historical forebears.

The Evolution from Cosmopolis to Civium.

The thesis of Cosmo-Local Production sees a potential convergence between the bioregionally organized productive communities, and the knowledge and capital available through the translocal virtual communities. Distributed local production and manufacturing marries powerful translocal technologies for collaboration and capital formation.

Under neoliberalism, nation-states were competing to attract the globally floating capital, a process which is still going on, but there is now an added layer of crypto capital, which is linked and embodied in the population of Web3 using digital nomads, a concept we can use very flexibly not just for the 50 million people who actually already moved, but to everyone who is relatively place-independent in his work.

On the localization front, we recently learned from Frederic Bosque that there has been a tenfold increase of eco-villages in France, from 150 ten years ago, to more or less 1500 today, and this figure is even more stunning when you realize a failure rate of 80%, which indicates a lot more projects were tried.

According to Jordan Hall, these projects are part of the Civium, a global network of interconnected places, i.e. the oases, coupled with the moving popup villages of the associated nomads, which represent a new form of collective intelligence, in which rural places are now as well connected as urban places, leading to a reconfiguration of territories away from the larger cities. In the West, this process has already begun, but even China has stopped its relentless program of urbanization, by reconfiguring its real estate sector to liberate capital for manufacturing and infrastructure.

Here is an extended quote from Jordan Hall:

Let’s take a moment to examine the nature of “the digital.” When Andreesen pointed out that “software is eating the world,” he wasn’t kidding around. Digital represents the absolute essence of ‘mediation’. Consider: writing mediates some aspects of language while the telephone mediates other aspects. The telegraph still others. A photograph mediates some aspects of image, a moving picture still others. But digital can (and does) perform *all* of these functions. Digital can express any particular form of mediation.

What this means is that this notion of the ephemeralization of communication will reach its ultimate extension somewhere in the domain of the digital. Barring a significant social collapse of our technological civilization (which is entirely plausible!) it is just a matter of time. The helter skelter endeavor to solve the problem of how to get more and more people into communication by means of innovation and wealth finds its end point somewhere in the digital.And if the power of superlinear scaling is as I suggest, then the driver moving the history of civilization will continue to do its work. But, with the center of superlinear scaling moved from the physical to the virtual, the balance of power between these two regimes will begin to shift. While the territorial powers will do their best to hold onto their populations, and may succeed for quite some time, ultimately the dynamo of superlinear scaling will subordinate them, just as the city subordinated the indigenous modes of humanity that preceded it.In the end, this attractor will seek to bring everyone into a single “network”. But, instead of a giant megalopolis, the forces of superlinear scaling will turn their attentions towards the formation of a planetary network connecting, in principle, all minds.”(https://medium.com/@jordangreenhall/from-city-to-civium-5838e0cdfe31)

How is the Cosmopolis described by Venkatesh Rao linked to the Civium ?:

A nation-state is a territorially defined political unit.

A metropolis is a dense agglomeration of physical network nodes that coincide within a tight geography, in the form of a converged physical supernode that requires high human density to function.

A cosmopolis is the geographic field of diffusion of a set of behaviors associated with a particular powerful technology.

Territorial logic, nodal logic, and behavioral logic all induce societal protocols of various sorts, but it is my contention that of the three kinds of entities, the cosmopolis, by virtue of being the most ethereal, tends to co-evolve with technology the most. As a result, a cosmopolis is typically also a technological frontier of some sort, digesting the fruits of ongoing technological evolution into new and persistent civilizational layers that transform political geography.”

Source:

So my understanding is that the Civium is the form that the Cosmopolis takes when empowered by the digital.

The Digital Cosmopolis, the Civium, is a particular form that trans-localization can take.

While China has extended the influence of its civilizational ‘nation-state’ through the Belt and Road initiative, and while the West hoped to retain global hegemony it once had through global neoliberal supply-chains through its its global digital media firms, the Cosmo-Local Regenerative Communities are in the process of doing the same, they arfe building the Civium.

Austin Wade Smith makes the following distinction:

State based nations = Nation State

State based nations = Nation State

Market based nations = Network State

Market based nations = Network State

Commons based nations = Network Nations

Commons based nations = Network Nations

So what Balaji Srivananasan proposes is to crowdfund capital in the Web3 ecosystem, and to purchase territory in agreement with existing states, and to negotiate forms of autonomy and sovereignty, and these different places can be interconnected in powerful federations of similarly minded network states. But the vision of such states is as a corporate state, much like 17th century Holland. In my understanding, you are not a citizen, but a shareholder, because the network state has a certain ideological content, linked to libertarian ideals. These indeed seem to be ‘market-based nations’.

So think of it this way:

The Network State is an expression of the merchant class, which has become cosmopolitan and nomadic,

The Civilization State is the expression of the statist political class, the neo-Mandarins of our time

The Civium, or Archipelago of Regenerative Villages is the expression of the bioregional but cosmo-local citizens.

The Civium, or Archipelago of Regenerative Villages is the expression of the bioregional but cosmo-local citizens.

The latter ideal is often expressed as ‘Network Nations’, as expressed for example through the workshops led by researcher Primavera de Filippi, which represents a more progressive vision of the non-territorial community form, and to which I have collaborated on occasion:

"“Network Nations” are:

(1) interdependent political communities

(2) united by shared aspirations, values and culture

(3) leveraging networked technologies

(4) to govern themselves, mutualise resources and engage in collective action,

(5) in a sovereign manner (i.e. independent layer alongside existing jurisdictions)

Network Nations aim to provide an institutional framework for emergent political communities of kinship to govern and coordinate themselves through networked technologies, creating new layers of sovereignty that subsist beyond the reach of nation states and private corporations. By acknowledging, and at times even furthering, their interdependencies — with one another, and other political actors — Network Nations can contribute to more effectively tackling global governance challenges that require global coordination. Indeed, by reintroducing a sense of belonging to communities that people genuinely want to "live for," Network Nations strive to rebuild trust among individuals and provide hope that they and their communities have a meaningful voice and role in the political arena."

In a recent workshop document, the participants seemed to stress the distributed territoriality, making a sharper contrast with the network state concept:

"A network of geographically unbound but interconnected local units. This structure allows for communities that are both locally rooted and globally connected, enabling them to act collectively as a larger, interwoven whole without being confined to a single territory."

Imagine the following process: a number of local regenerative projects decide to create a common federated identity. They create a DAO as a shadow structure for their collaboration, and acquire tools for financial sovereignty as a unified network nation or state. The challenge for the coming phase of civilization becomes one of reconciling the differences and contradictions between territorial organization and their sovereignty, with the new forms of trans-local collaboration with potential autonomy.

My own cosmo-local imagination, which is based on many years of observation on the ground, is that micro-territorial entities with similar domain-specific activities, say permaculture, would unite trans-locally through the use of common global infrastructure, but also have access to crowdfunded global capital, inventing new forms of ‘entangled’ fractal ownership.

Please note that the technology to do this already exists, at least in germ form!

See for example the True Commons Infrastructure, as described by Sensorica:

Beyond the Ledger: Why Blockchain and DAOs Fall Short for Complex Economic Organizations, and How OVNs Point the Way Forward

How to advance the Cosmo-Local Transition Agenda ?

Imagine on the one hand, bioregionally coordinated regenerative projects, organizing in mutual solidarity. A recent report by Benjamin Life described the Bioregional Coordination Frameworks already available, and there are Bioregional Financing Facilities to fund these developments.

But, on the other hand,

functional groups engaged in similar practices would unite with their brothers and sisters in the rest of the world, through powerful open source communities. Bioregionalism hereby represents horizontal solidarity, while cosmo-localism propers represents vertical, domain-specific forms of coordination.

What we are still lacking are the kind of formal coordination and financing frameworks that we already have for bioregional development, and this should be a priority.

The important point is that, if there is a successful combination of local productive power and distributed global capital, these entities can become very powerful, and operate on a global scale. They could be the equals of a number of territorial nations, and even surpass them, with capacities to mobilize capital that outstrip that of territorial entities. But because these are commons-centric form of organization, which depend on their commons, they could be agents of resource and ecological protection, continuing the role that commons have played historically, but at a much higher level of scale.

Of course, the devil will be in the details. For example, will the China model allow such entities to operate ? What will be the political reactions, for example, would more conservative populist governments react differently than ‘progressive neoliberal administrations’. But I predict that many regional governments will see the benefits in collaborating and attracting such entities. Part of the agency of such translocal groups is that they do not necessarily have to pass through their nation state, they can network in a multitude of ways and negotiate support at different scales. They may well create ‘isonomic’ competition between the various territorial entities that are interested in attracting them for mutual benefit and collaboration.

But the main point is that these forces will gradually become more powerful and influential and interact with geographic entities.

David de Ugarte of the legendary las indias group, which has now gone underground, as many in the Web3 sphere have been doing with their ‘dark forest’ ‘cozywebs’, spoke of Neo-Venetian Networks, i.e. community-centric global business networks, or ‘Phyles’. But phyles still represents forms of network agency that are not necessarily aligned to the broader common good.

As I have explained elsewhere, we have a crisis of global regulation, and neither market self-regulation nor pure inter-state regulation, let alone a world government, seem particularly attractive. Can we imagine some of these cosmo-local networks as evolving towards becoming powerful regulatory players, which I have called ‘Magisteria of the Commons’.

Whatever the exact outcome, East-West-Digital will be a reality, and no analysis that is confined to the ‘West vs the Rest’ will be adequate in explaining geopolitics. There is a third kid on the block: the translocal commons networks.

Understanding the Necessity of a Cosmo-Local Shift Towards Post-Civilizational and ‘Pluriversic’ Planetarity

It seems increasingly clear to many that we are in a civilizational intercycle, i.e. at the end of one civilizational cycle, but not yet at a real beginning of another.

What kind of civilizational cycles are ending, exactly ?

Michel’s Substack: Fourth Generation Civilization is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

First of all, there is the Kondratieff cycle, which is an economic cycle in which a new form of energy, of management, of working the land, synergizes together in some kind of integrated logic, that works for a while. As every cycle it emerges, has a peak, declines, and collapses to make place for another. There is little doubt that 2008 was the end of one such cycle, the

“neoliberal” cycle, and that the world economy has not found its stride back. Thus, a lack of integration of new technological capacities in a way that makes sense.

Somewhat longer is the civic generational cycle of one hundred years, identified in the book, The Fourth Turning. When such a cycle ends, we are now in the last disintegrating phase of such a cycle, i.e. the political and civic institutions itself which are at stake. This is what we generally consider to be a ‘Crisis of Democracy’.

This cycle seems very much in tune with the ‘hegemonic cycle’, which is a cycle of geopolitical dominance, and coincides with a cycle of war. The cycle that started with the American dominance after WWII, and its attendant world order, is disintegrating as we speak, and with it, comes the acute danger of war between the allies of the old hegemon, and those of new hegemonic candidates, or alternatively with the supporters of multipolarity, the BRICS alliance.

Here is a brief review of important insights of major macro-historians as well.

If we believe Oswald Spenger, there is a more or less one thousand year long civilizational cycle as well, and as he estimates that ‘European’ civilization started around 998, with the instantiation of both the Holy Roman Empire in Germany, and the french monarchy of the Capetians, we are also at the end of this particular civilizational form, which was a fusion between the Germanic and the post-Roman, infused by a religion from the Middle East. Within the civilizational cycle, Spengler also noted a 500-year cycle between decentralization and centralization, attested by Toynbee as well. A civilization starts as a culture, but which exists as a networked reality between a larger number of players, i.e. the emerging city-states. Think about the Greek Polis, or the Italian city-states, or the Warring States period of China. As they grow independently of each other, they struggle for hegemony, and tend to exhaust each other. This exhaustion in turn leads to the invasion of the civilizational sphere, whether this is Greece, or Italy and Europe, by a peripheral semi ‘barbarian’ state, which unifies the conquered sphere as a centralized and universalistic empire. With the demise of the power of the steppe nomads, this dynamic will of course be substantially different this time. We should also stress that the crisis of ‘Western’-dominated civilizational forms, is a crisis of the world system, since all other civilizational spheres, to the degree they still exist and are not just cultural spheres, all function largely through capital markets and nation-states institution. But bear in mind we will amend this insight when we focus on an incipient struggle between ‘East’ and ‘West’, or between what some call ‘the global majority’ (the BRICS alliance) and the old Western core.

Arnold Toynbee also stresses that civilization itself is evolutionary. A first form of civilization, exemplified in Mesopotamia, transforms itself through the adoption of world religions, the so-called Axial Age, then again, through industrialization which leads to the spread of the nation-state model, and we can argue, reaching a new stage where cognitive and symbolic process take the upper hand. Here also, complications have arisen, and we should seriously consider that the next stage of ‘civilizational evolution’, could also be characterized as a ‘post-civilizational’ reality. Notice that this author does believe that the evolution of human society, just as the evolution of matter and life, is beholden to phase transitions in the level of complexity (taking into account possible disintegrations towards lower forms of complexity).

Pitirim Sorokin has also insisted that there is a pendulum quality to civilizational change, essentially between the Sensate and Ideate models. Sensate cultures focus on the material, on empirical reality and tend to reject the spiritual orientation to life; while Ideate cultures reject the material orientation to focus on spiritual development, think of medieval Christianity of Indian Buddhism as such Ideate forces. Once such a societal form has exhausted itself, and has saturated a lifeworld, it provokes a contrary reaction. Thus, hedonistic Rome produced ascetic Christianity, while by the 17th century, the merchant classes in Northern Europe had grown disgusted by the ‘idleness’ of the monks and clergy, inaugurating phase shifts in their societies. In other civilizational spheres, such as the Sinic, we may observe similar pendulum swings between centralized phases with pragmatic legists or Confucians, and decentralized swings with the growth of Buddhist or Taoist reactions. Why is this important: do not expect what comes after civilizational intercycles to be simple evolutionary jumps towards ‘more complexity’; they are also radical bifurcations and value revolutions.

I will not stress here the major role of technology, not least of all military technology, but especially the role of media, in inducing phase shifts in society. The best way to understand the importance of media is in their capacity ‘to hold complexity’, by governing the relation between matter and energy. Media are essential to the level of coordination a society is capable of. As Eric Chaisson argued: “The more complex the order is, the denser the energy flows that pass through it.”

But we believe an even deeper change is afoot, which is why I sometimes speak of a post-civilizational shift. Essentially for two reasons.

One has to do with our new technological revolution. Civilization was essentially a geographic arrangement, between the agricultural countryside, and its capacity to create a surplus to develop differentiated cities. So the agricultural surplus eventually created industrial capacity, and the surplus of the latter creates a further surplus for cognitive-type societies. While we at first created ever faster coordination techniques, we have achieved a fundamentally different capacity today, that of translocal self-organization. In other words, there is a physical domain, pertaining to geographic organization in territories, which took the form of nation-states and of networked globalization, but there is also a sphere of virtual domains, in which humans can self-organize new value circuits relatively independent of their physical location, and can coordinate in real-time. So there is a tension in our societies between the forces that want to restabilize society, at least to a certain degree, through a return to ‘nation-states’ or civilization states, and post-national forces of different kinds. While this is not new, religious communities were trans-local and supported the establishment of more stable imperial structures, trans-locality has achieved a quantum level of capacity this time around.

The second reason has to do with our environmental crisis which is a fundamental crisis of our relation with our lifeworld, around the necessary recognition of our interdependence, and the lack of regard of our capitalist systems for so-called ‘externalities’, which far from being such, are the very basis of the planetary survival for life. Indigenous societies were participative regarding their natural environment, and they considered other living beings as kin, being animated by powerful spiritual beings which demanded a certain respect, in terms of their exploitation for human need. We should never forget the very successful temporal reproduction of indigenous societies: the Australian Aboriginals for example, are believed to have reproduced their culture for over 50,000 years. Most civilizational models last a few hundred years only, and the civilizational model has been rocked by major recurring Dark Ages, lasting on average 500 years long, each time with a larger footprint.

There is a clear descending line concerning our relationship to the natural world.

For example, this is from a summary in Point Zero, Vol. I, a book on civilizational development by Boris Sirbey, which stresses the increased distance and differentiation between the human mentality, and the natural lifeworld, throughout civilizational evolution. The following is a summary of the scheme summarized in that book:

For animists, like say the Columbian Kogi or the Australian Aboriginals, everything in nature is alive and conscious, including rocks and forms of matter considered to be ‘without life’ by us moderns..

After this, a real break occurs, which becomes increasingly radical:

Finally, humanity reaches a nihilistic phase, in which it prefers the dead universe above life itself.

Finally, humanity reaches a nihilistic phase, in which it prefers the dead universe above life itself.

Whatever the merit of this scheme, I believe it usefully shows the direction of differentiation between humanity and its lifeworld: an increasing separation, and which demands a renewed integration,.

It seems we have indeed reached an endpoint of sorts in this form of ‘dominion’.

Civilization may be said to have been a response to natural challenges, and it was born in the massive efforts to direct the flow of water for human benefit, in the river deltas of Mesopotamia and China, as well as elsewhere later on. Civilization is based both on agriculture, and on the mining needed for weaponry. In that context, ideologies, imaginaries and narratives gradually arose which place the human above nature, as its steward first, later as its master. But while pre-capitalist civilizational forms had regional scope, respected the nature- and resource-preserving local commons institutions, capitalism became a globally extractive system which has serially exhausted the whole planetary sphere and is endangering the very reproductive cycles of nature.

Clearly, we may have reached Peak Civilization, and hence a Great Unraveling, if we mean by that at least the two aspects I have mention:

Civilization as a geographic entity

Civilization as a geographic entity

Civilization as a master-slave paradigm regarding nature.

Civilization as a master-slave paradigm regarding nature.

So, we may either speak of a further evolution of civilization towards a new civilizational form, what the Chinese call ‘Ecological Civilization’, or we can argue, as I sometimes do, that it is the civilizational cycle itself which is at stake. The first time I found this thesis was in Keith Chandler’s book, Beyond Civilization, which I read several decades ago. I cannot recommend it enough.

So in terms of our cycles, we are conceiving of a shift of a cycle which has probably lasted 12,000 years, when a receding Ice Age made possible new forms of agriculture.

Now clearly, keeping in mind the ‘Point Zero’ scheme above, we cannot just go ‘back’ to indigenous social systems, which only supported a few million people on the planet. But we can clearly learn from them.

The evolution of matter, life and human culture always proceed through a process of differentiation, then re-integration, as we have learned from the science of complexity.

This means that we must conceive of the next evolutionary phase as a re-integration, a synthesis, of:

The temporality, balance, and harmony, of indigenous cultures

The temporality, balance, and harmony, of indigenous cultures

The societal complexity and differentiation of ‘civilizational’ societies.

The societal complexity and differentiation of ‘civilizational’ societies.

This is what we mean with the ‘post-civilizational challenge’, and I have often referred, in our other articles, to the scheme proposed by Kojin Karatani, which is that humanity tries, ever again, to restore the conviviality of what he calls Mode A (gifting and commoning), to a higher level of complexity, i.e. Mode D, so as to overcome, the civilizational modes of coordination, i.e. Mode B, the State, and Mode C, the market form. Our first trial were the Axial religions, which were instrumental in stabilizing the imperial forms (China, Byzantium, Islam), followed by mass ideologies, instrumental in creating and stabilizing the nation-state, and today, ‘constructive translocal productive networks’, which will hopefully be the format for post-civilization. Post-Civilization, if it emerges, or the Fourth Mode of Civilization, will be the successful integrative modality to emerge after the Great Unraveling.

Bear in mind that, apart from surviving the expected climate dislocation, we need to maintain the kind of technological stock that can protect the 400 nuclear energy plants from disintegration. We need to maintain (and develop!!) decent living standards for the human population, avoiding human mass death, without the destruction of the entire lifeworld. And we must maintain acceptable levels of human equality in order to have relative social peace. While it is far from certain we will succeed, I believe such a mobilizing narrative gives us a better chance at the future than either the escapist fantasies of the transhumanists, or the utter doom that is promised to us by certain environmentalists. Note that I do not dismiss their warnings, but we must continue to find ways to overcome this crisis.

I believe there is an obvious solution to the current conundrum of maintaining the essential advances of human civilization to date, and the longevity of a participatory human civilization which can last for a few million years on the other side of the unraveling: and that is, the radical implementation of mutualization at a planetary scale.

Mutualization means ‘doing more with less’, through the sharing of resources, and it has been the perennial response of humanity in terms of crisis. And each time, it is achieved by reviving the institution of the commons. As I have demonstrated elsewhere in my hypothesis of the Pulsation of the Commons, in times of civilizational degradation, the commons return, and in dark ages, commons institutions even become hegemonic.

In this context, we have posited the potentiality of a new post-civilizational world order, which we call cosmo-localism.

It posits:

The relocalization of production closer to human need, which could diminish matter-energy usage by two-thirds

The relocalization of production closer to human need, which could diminish matter-energy usage by two-thirds

The mutualization of such production and consumption, which can diminish matter-energy usage by another 80%.

The mutualization of such production and consumption, which can diminish matter-energy usage by another 80%.

There are plenty of cases and social experiments to show that this is a real pragmatic possibility, but a lot of obstacles are in the way. And this is why we must also be ‘realistic’ in our assumptions, and look at the current Geopolitical situation of the world.

This will be the topic for part II of this article, which will focus on the ‘Long Arc of Eurasian Strife’ and present the ‘East West Digital’ framing for cosmo-local geopolitics.

In the meantime, think of the challenge of the new integration as the necessary merging of both a new form of post-Western universalism, i.e. Planetarity, and two forms of diversity, i.e. the geographic and diasporic cultural diversity associated with the long cultural and ethnic histories of human groups,  who have a genuine desire to protect their continuity and specificity, as evidenced in the construction of regionalisms, localisms, national histories and currently, ‘civilization states’, but also the diversity of global virtual domains, but really ‘phygital’ domains, with both material and virtual aspects, of the emerging collaborating cosmo-local alliances. How will we square such divergent demands ?

Some context, by Michel Bauwens:

This week, we are running a guest editorial by the French activist and ecovillage founder Frédéric Bosqué. Though self-governed guild cities have existed in different civilizational spheres, the European continent remains distinctive in that it had no unified Empire (of the Holy Roman Empire it was said that is was neither holy, nor Roman nor an Empire), and therefore, the free cities of the European Middle Ages had an enormous leeway to become self-governed, through the coalition of their craft and merchant guilds. This period was therefore marked by a tradition of cooperation and self-governance, which takes center place in Kropotkin’s famous history of ‘mutual aid’. Postmodern authors have urged Europeans to provincialize and not to impose their own models as universal, but this also implies a respect for our (I am European myself) traditions, as much as other civilizational spheres may be inspired by their own, as we try to renew them in this era of transition. Ask Mammouth.AI for an overview of self-governed guild cities all over the world and it will introduce you to guild cities in Africa and India.

This is why I particularly like this contribution, which links the historical past to the new potentialities of the present, not just in theory and vision, but as a pragmatic approach.

Guest Editorial

Frédéric Bosqué:

"The air of the city makes one free."

This medieval proverb echoed like a promise of emancipation eight centuries ago. In the 12th century, free cities—towns liberated from feudal lordship—offered runaway serfs both freedom and new opportunities. In a cruel paradox, the air of today’s modern metropolises seems filled more with anxiety than with freedom. The ecological crisis weighs heavily on our collective psyche: more than 10 million French people suffer from eco-anxiety, a condition even more pronounced in urban areas. It’s no surprise that 57% of city dwellers dream of leaving the city to live closer to nature. The suffocation of concrete is being met by the call of a "Rurality 2.0," where hope for a sustainable future is being reborn.

In response to the exhaustion of the individualistic urban model, a new path is emerging, following in the footsteps of our ancestors from the free communes: that of “territories of life.” This concept places the territory—the village, the town, the local community—at the heart of development, rather than the isolated individual. It is a return to the roots of cooperation, but with the awareness and tools of the 21st century.

Committed and humanistic, this article offers a journey from the past into the future: from medieval free cities to the territorial cooperative ecosystems that are now beginning to blossom. We will discover how social innovation, which already served as a driver of modernization in the Middle Ages, could very well be the seed of a present-day civilizational shift. Get ready to revisit history in order to better imagine your own future—and who knows, perhaps take action in service of life itself.

Medieval Free Cities: When Freedom Built Modernity

At the heart of the Middle Ages, a silent revolution was unfolding in the shadow of city walls. Starting in the 12th century, many European towns obtained charters of franchise that granted rights and privileges to their inhabitants. A free city (or ville libre) was no longer the property of a feudal lord—it belonged to its emancipated townspeople, who governed themselves collectively. “Franche” means free: these cities had broken away from the rigid feudal regime. Gone were the arbitrary demands of forced labor and feudal taxes; the residents set their own rules, elected aldermen or consuls, and raised their own belfries, symbols of their autonomy.

The proverb of the time, “the air of the city makes one free,” bears witness to this historical turning point: anyone who resided for a year and a day within the walls of a free commune was no longer considered a serf. A new social class, the urban bourgeoisie, began to flourish, drawing in artisans, merchants, and scholars to these centers of emancipation.

The rise of free cities profoundly transformed Europe. Freed from feudal constraints, the inhabitants multiplied their initiatives. They founded merchant guilds, trade corporations, laid the foundations of international commerce, and invented the first banks. In cities like Bruges, Venice, or Lyon, innovation flourished: the art of navigation was refined, towering cathedrals were built, and the first universities were created. Each free city became a laboratory of social experimentation. Thrust into responsibility for their own governance, these once-subjugated citizens learned self-organization and wove the early threads of what would later be called civil society.

Driven by necessity, they institutionalized mutual aid through brotherhoods, built hospitals (Hôtels-Dieu), and welcomed the new ideas brought by the mendicant orders. Knowledge and wealth circulated in an unprecedented whirlwind of activity.

These medieval communes redefined European civilization, opening the door to new economic, social, and intellectual horizons. In the span of a few centuries, Europe transitioned from a stagnant feudal patchwork to a dynamic network of interconnected cities. This autonomous urban model, despite its internal inequalities, ignited the spark of modernity. More importantly, it showed that social innovation—by rewriting the political and economic rules—could overturn an entire system.

Indeed, the gradual emancipation of free cities continually pushed the boundaries of local autonomy, eventually challenging royal authority and the feudal order itself. The feudal monarchy would ultimately be swept away centuries later by the legacy of this thirst for freedom. The message of the free cities is clear: when communities dare to place human dignity, solidarity, and the common good at the center, they change the course of history.

Territory of Life: Reinventing Development on a Human Scale

While the industrial era and the contemporary age have glorified the individual and the isolated enterprise, the next phase of our development may well lie in what is called the “territory of life.” But what exactly does this mean? A territory of life is a local space—a village, a neighborhood, a small region—conceived as a living organism where actors cooperate for life: their own, that of the community, and of nature. It is a break from the “every person for themselves” mindset. Here, the relevant scale is neither the sovereign individual nor the distant State, but the interconnected local community. The goal is to balance individual autonomy and the common good, as two sides of the same coin.

Joining a territory of life is a bit like joining a tightly knit team after years of working alone. One discovers the power of the collective: energies are pooled, skills complement each other. Instead of being subjected to a top-down system, residents regain control over their daily lives. Practically speaking, in a territory of life, people collectively decide to relocalize food production, co-create ecological housing, or share essential services. The territory becomes an open-air laboratory for ground-level innovation—with and for the people.

This territorial approach speaks to a growing search for meaning. Many eco-anxious city dwellers dream of “going green,” not out of selfish escapism, but to regain agency. They sense that, in the city, despite sorting their waste or biking on weekends, their impact is negligible in the face of climate challenges. In contrast, on a territory of life, every action counts and is visible: planting a tree, installing solar panels on the village school, opening a cooperative grocery store… These are concrete acts that immediately strengthen the community’s resilience. Here, one can measure their own impact. One is no longer an anonymous cog in an opaque economic machine, but a local agent of change. It’s deeply motivating and a powerful source of hope.

Of course, a territory of life doesn’t mean living in isolated self-sufficiency or idealizing a “return to the good old days.” On the contrary, it’s about reconciling modernity with proximity. Digital tools and technological innovations have their place, but they are reclaimed by and for the local. For example, a web platform allows local producers to sell directly to consumers; an app connects people offering and needing help within the community. The individual is not crushed by the collective: they are supported by it. Each person can deploy their talents with the gratifying sense of contributing to a tangible common good. Success shifts from being defined by competition (being the best in your corner) to being defined by cooperation (succeeding together in meeting everyone’s basic needs).

By restoring a human scale to our ambitions, the territory of life emerges as a new horizon of development. It is the fertile ground where an economy in service of life can take root. Here, entrepreneurship returns to its original meaning: taking into our hands the shaping of our living environment according to our values. It is neither nostalgic retreat nor naïve utopia: territories of life are already writing a new chapter in the human journey—step by step—at the local level, in synergy with the global.

Social Innovation: Seed of a New Civilization

At every major turning point in history, technical inventions have played their role… but it is social innovations that have made the difference between mere evolution and a true civilizational shift. So, what is a social innovation? It’s not a high-tech gadget or just another app. It is a new way of being and acting together: a local currency circulating in a short supply chain, participatory governance in a village, or a novel model of cooperation among local actors. At its core, it means reinventing our social structures to align with our deep human needs and planetary limits. And if we reflect on it, the birth of free cities (cités franches) in the Middle Ages was one of the greatest social innovations in European history. In comparison, inventions like the compass or the printing press—important as they were—could not have transformed society without this new foundation of communal freedoms, citizen initiative, and shared responsibility.

Today, we find ourselves once again at a crossroads. Technologies are evolving at breakneck speed, but our social organization is struggling to keep up. We see it clearly: without social adaptation, technical innovations too often lead to divisions, misunderstandings, or even violent rejection. It's not enough to have green solutions on paper if, in practice, people cannot or will not adopt them. This is why social innovation is at the heart of today’s civilizational shift. It aims to create fertile ground so that our scientific and technological advances truly serve the common good. In this sense, it is the precondition for a successful transition: it prepares minds, weaves connections, and builds trust and solidarity, without which no sustainable ecosystem can thrive.

Let’s go back to the free cities: their contribution was not limited to city walls or merchant halls. What they truly left us was a new imaginary—one of emancipation, collaboration among equals, and merit based on work rather than birth. In the same way, today’s rural laboratories and citizen movements offer much more than wind turbines or organic gardens. They are experimenting with new ways to decide together, to share fairly, to infuse meaning into the economy. Every collective attempting distributed governance, every social enterprise reinvesting profits in the community, every group of neighbors creating a solidarity-based third place, is a trailblazer of a new era.

Certainly, social innovation is more discreet than technological innovation. It rarely makes the headlines in business media, and it often moves forward through trial and error. But its transformative power is immense, because it touches our values and behaviors. It is a change from within society itself. Why cling to what is dying, when the seed of fraternity needs only a little earth, water, and sunlight to grow toward the boundless sky of possibilities? This is the question that more and more of us are beginning to ask ourselves. It marks a transition from “We know this no longer works” to “We’re going to do things differently—together.”

Look around you: this quiet movement is gaining momentum. Citizens are gathering to create commons (shared gardens, rural fablabs, cooperative childcare centers…). Mayors are encouraging participatory budgets or local water management boards, signs that another way of governing is possible. Businesses are turning into SCOPs or SCICs to involve both workers and users. These initiatives may seem small or local, but when added together, they sketch out the possible face of a new, more resilient and more solidaristic civilization. Social innovation is the seed of tomorrow’s world: still fragile, but immensely fertile if we give it a chance. And it is at the scale of territories of life that this seed can grow, sheltered from the storms of the global mega-economy, until it spreads everywhere.

Today’s Cooperative Ecosystems: The Boldness of the TERA Project in Lustrac, France

These reflections aren’t just theoretical—they are rooted in real-world projects. In the Lot-et-Garonne region of France, for example, our collective has been working since 2015 to build what it calls a "cooperative ecosystem for the 21st century."

The project, named TERA, began with a handful of pioneers and a vision: to create a rural village of the future, capable of locally meeting the needs of its inhabitants while respecting both people and nature. Today, after a decade of incubation, that dream is about to take concrete form near Tournon-d’Agenais, close to the banks of the Lot River. For now, it’s just an empty field in the hamlet of Lustrac, next to an old medieval mill. It’s hard to imagine that soon this space will host the first pilot rural neighborhood in transition, built entirely from scratch. Yet in three years’ time, the site will house ecological homes, a training center for eco-construction (to be completed within a month), lightweight accommodations for students and travelers, along with energy and food production facilities and a composting site. Sound utopian? On the contrary, it’s the result of patient social innovation like the one we've been discussing throughout this piece.

TERA is structured as a genuine territorial cooperative ecosystem. In plain terms, it's “a collective of individuals and organizations cooperating to revitalize a rural area while respecting people and nature.” Its stated goal sets the tone: “to relocalize 85% of the vital needs of local residents.” In other words, to produce locally the essential goods and services that sustain the community (food, energy, materials, etc.), thereby regaining economic and ecological sovereignty.

The project relies on five interdependent pillars:

Localizing production

Creating a proximity-based distribution network

Using a complementary local currency

Establishing open and participatory governance

And ultimately,

guaranteeing an autonomy income to each resident actively involved.

guaranteeing an autonomy income to each resident actively involved.

This last point is particularly groundbreaking: the wealth generated by the ecosystem is meant to fairly compensate every contributor, breaking free from the precariousness of volunteerism. “We want to create a real economic model,” explains the president of the cooperative driving the project. Indeed, many ecological initiatives depend on the elbow grease of passionate but burned-out volunteers. TERA, however, aims for social durability, progressively ensuring fair income through locally rooted activities.

The TERA project in Lustrac isn’t alone — but it’s emblematic. It draws a striking parallel with the free cities of old. Just as medieval communes once invented new rules to flourish outside the feudal system, TERA is inventing new ways to live and generate wealth outside the rigid framework of the globalized economy. This small “territory of life” is gradually experimenting with a nearly complete circular economy: soon, euros will circulate less than local citizen currency backed by the territory’s real production. Residents will no longer rely on distant, anonymous markets for their electricity or vegetables—they’ll produce them together, knowing exactly where, how, and by whom they were made. To that end, a collective-interest cooperative (SCIC) has been formed with local stakeholders, proving that businesses, citizens, and public authorities can be partners—not competitors. This reflects the balance once dreamed of by free cities: enough local autonomy to ensure freedom, and enough openness to remain connected to the wider world. In fact, far from retreating from society, the TERA ecosystem collaborates with researchers, foundations, and local officials to become a replicable model. It has even been certified as a Territorial Hub for Economic Cooperation (PTCE)—official recognition of its innovative and scalable nature.

On the ground, the first concrete results are already revitalizing the four municipalities where the project is steadily progressing. A 12-hectare permaculture farm in Masquières. A cooperative grocery store and brewery (L’Alvéole and L’Aménité) in the heart of Tournon-d’Agenais to distribute products through short supply chains. In Trentels, the Eco-Construction Center will be delivered on July 15th and already employs five full-time staff.

These non-relocatable local jobs are even helping to reverse population decline! Most importantly, a new collective spirit is uniting long-time residents and new arrivals. Local know-how is being passed on and reimagined. Together, people are innovating. By breathing new life into this once-forgotten rural area, TERA demonstrates that our countryside holds real answers to today’s crises—provided we invest in them, humanly and financially. This is not a refuge for urban hipsters seeking greenery. It is a civilization-building site in the open air, where tomorrow’s ways of life are already under construction.

Of course, nothing is simple. It took eight years of hard work to reach this point — overcoming administrative and financial hurdles, persuading skeptics. But each challenge has been a chance to invent, adapt, and co-create new responses. Step by step, these territorial cooperative ecosystems are shaping a realistic and desirable horizon. They prove that another future is possible—here and now—if we are willing to make it happen. By linking the historical inspiration of the free cities with the boldness of today’s projects like TERA, a coherent trajectory emerges: returning power to local communities to place the economy back at the service of life. The circle closes… and the story continues—with us.

From the birth of free cities to modern cooperative ecosystems, a red thread runs through it all: solidarity-based autonomy in service of the common good. History teaches us that the greatest transformations often begin locally, driven by ordinary people willing to do things differently. Today, the most relevant scale of change may well be your village, your neighborhood, your own territory of life. This is where change is within reach, and where you can become a part of the renewal.

And you — in your job, your city, your daily life — are you managing to innovate socially, to put the economy at the service of life? If the answer is no—or not enough—maybe it’s time to gather your courage and act.

You don’t need a “perfect plan” or a miracle solution to start. Each of us can join a local initiative, build connections, contribute our piece to the puzzle. Remember: the burghers of the Middle Ages weren’t superhuman heroes—just people determined to improve their lot by helping one another. Similarly, today’s territories of life don’t require saints or experts—just citizens willing to learn and build together. The transition is no walk in the park—it demands courage, perseverance, and faith in humanity—but what more beautiful or meaningful adventure could there be?

Chances are, a few years from now, you’ll look back with pride. Maybe you’ll have helped reopen a school in the countryside, launch an energy cooperative, or start a community farm with your neighbors. However small, these victories are the soil from which global change grows. So—what are you waiting for to join a territory of life where you can take action? If where you are now you can’t spread your wings, change your air—go where your commitment can make something real bloom.

Now is the time to turn your dreams into reality.

I invite you to take action today."
